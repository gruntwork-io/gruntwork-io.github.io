== Intro

This guide will walk you through how to update from version 1.3.0 to version 1.4.0 of the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark.
If your infrastructure is already compliant with the Benchmark's version 1.3.0, and you are looking to upgrade to v1.4.0,
this guide is for you. If you are starting to work on compliance with this benchmark from scratch, check out our
https://gruntwork.io/guides/compliance/how-to-achieve-cis-benchmark-compliance/[How to achieve compliance with the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark]
guide instead. If your infrastructure is compliant with the Benchmark's version 1.2.0, check out our guide
https://gruntwork.io/guides/upgrades/how-to-update-to-cis-13/[How to update to CIS AWS version 1.3.0].

=== What you'll learn in this guide

This guide consists of two main sections:

<<core_concepts>>::
An overview of the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.4.0 and why it is important to update your code for compatibility.

<<deployment_walkthrough>>::
The steps you need to take to update your code to be compliant with CIS AWS v1.4.0. It includes a
<<compatibility_table,version compatibility table>> you can use as a reference to know which Gruntwork Repo version
tag is compatible with CIS AWS v1.4.0, as well as the manuals step you need to perform to achieve said compliance.

== Core Concepts

=== Background


==== Changes in recommendations
Changes in recommendations (both additions and removals) are listed below. You can think of these as a "diff"
between versions 1.2.0 and 1.3.0.

===== New recommendations
These are the new recommendations introduced in version 1.4.0 of the Benchmark:

- 2.1.3: Ensure MFA Delete is enable on S3 buckets
- 2.1.4: Ensure all data in Amazon S3 has been discovered, classified and secured when required
- 2.3.1: Ensure that encryption is enabled for RDS Instances

===== Updated recommendations
Version 1.4.0 updated a recommendation, it only affects the IAM password policy:

- 1.12: Ensure credentials unused for 45 days or greater are disabled. The previous recommendation required credentials older than 90 days to be disabled.

==== New Gruntwork modules vs. existing modules
To achieve compliance with the new version of the Framework, we created one new module in the
Gruntwork's Infrastructure as Code Library, and updated a bunch of existing modules. Recommendation 2.1.3
required creating a new module; the rest of the recommendations were achieved by updating existing modules.

To ensure compliance with version 1.4.0 of the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, you'll need to follow all the
instructions in the <<deployment_walkthrough>> section of this guide; precisely, follow Steps 1 and 2 to ensure that
the existing modules get updated to their CIS AWS v1.4.0 compliant versions and follow Step 3 to ensure that you install and
configure the newly created modules.

[NOTE]
====
Please follow the steps below to upgrade from version 1.2.0 to version 1.3.0 of the Benchmark. To see examples of what the relevant code
changes look like, please refer to these pull requests in the Acme CIS Reference Architecture:

* https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-infrastructure-modules-acme/pull/6[cis-infrastructure-modules-acme]
* https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-infrastructure-live-acme/pull/8[cis-infrastructure-live-acme]

=== Step 1: Update references to the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library

To update to the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.4.0, you need to update your references to the Gruntwork
Infrastructure as Code Library to use compatible versions. We (Gruntwork) have reviewed and updated all the library modules for compatibility with the new version of the Benchmark. As a customer, you need to update to
the proper versions of the Gruntwork library to pick up the fixes/changes made to be compatible. Refer to
https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library/#updating[the
"Updating" section of "How to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library"] for instructions on how to update the
versions in your code.

[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: Gruntwork follows
https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library/#versioning[semantic
versioning]. For any pre-1.0 modules, this means that version updates to the minor version are considered backward
incompatible releases for any version updates before the 1.0.0 release. Make sure to read the release notes for the
relevant modules any time you are updating minor versions! Note that you will want to read the release notes for each
minor version that is updated (e.g., if you are going from v0.5.x to v0.9.x, you will want to read the notes for v0.6.0,
v0.7.0, v0.8.0, and v0.9.0 to get the full list of backward incompatible updates).

The following table provides a summary of all the relevant Gruntwork AWS modules and the respective versions that are
compatible with CIS AWS v1.3.0:

=== Step 2: Manual steps

==== 1. Enable MFA Delete

Enabling MFA Delete in your bucket adds another layer of security by requiring MFA in any request to delete a version or change the versioning state of the bucket.

The attribute `mfa_delete` is only used by Terraform to https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket#mfa_delete[reflect the current state of the bucket]. It is not possible to create a bucket if the `mfa_delete` is `true`, because it needs to be activated https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete.html[using AWS CLI or the API].

To make this change [**you need to use the root user of the account**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html#aws_tasks-that-require-root) that owns the bucket, and MFA needs to be enabled.

**Note:** We do not recommend you to have access keys for the root user, so remember to delete them after you finish this.

In order to enable MFA Delete, you need to:
1. Create a bucket with `mfa_delete=false`.
1. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html#id_root-user_manage_add-key[Create access keys for the root user]
1. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html#id_root-user_manage_mfa[Configure MFA for the root user]
1. Using the root user, call the AWS CLI to enable MFA Delete. If you are using `aws-vault`, it is necessary to use the `--no-session` flag.
```
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --region <REGION> --bucket <BUCKET NAME> --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Enabled --mfa "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT ID>:mfa/root-account-mfa-device <MFA CODE>"
```
1. Set `mfa_delete=true`
1. Remove any Lifecycle Rule that the bucket might contain (the default is `{}`, in the AWS Config and Cloudtrail modules, you need to set `s3_enable_lifecycle_rules=false`).
1. Run `terraform apply`.
1. If there are no left S3 buckets to enable MFA Delete, delete the access keys for the root user, but NOT the MFA.

We also create a script to help you enable MFA Delete in all buckets from a single account at once.

==== 2. Enable Macie

TODO: our customers might have their own in house solution, so in this case they don't need to enable macie. ADD A NOTE FOR THAT

Macie is a new AWS resource and isn't still possible to automate the whole flow with Terraform.
