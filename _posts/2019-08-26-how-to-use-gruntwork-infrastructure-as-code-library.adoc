== Intro

This guide will walk you through how to use the
https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library] to define and manage a production-grade
tech stack as code on top of AWS or GCP.

=== What is the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library?

// TODO: update screenshot of the Infrastructure as Code Library when we launch the new design
.The Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-as-code-library/gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library.png[]

The https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library] is a collection of over 300,000
lines of reusable, battle-tested, production-ready infrastructure code for AWS and GCP that lets you:

Go to prod in days, not months::
  Most teams have the same basic infrastructure needs—e.g., Docker cluster, load balancer, database, cache, CI/CD,
  monitoring, secrets management, and so on—so instead of wasting months reinventing the wheel and building these
  same pieces from scratch, you get to leverage a library of reusable, battle-tested, off-the-shelf infrastructure
  that has been built by a team of DevOps experts and proven in production at hundreds of companies.

Customize everything using infrastructure as code::
  Everything in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library is defined as code (primarily in Terraform, Go, Python, and Bash) and
  as a Gruntwork Subscriber, you get access to 100% of this code. You can combine and compose this code in any way you
  wish, see how everything works under the hood, debug any issues you run into, and customize and modify the code to
  fit your exact needs.

Learn best practices::
  The Infrastructure as Code Library includes both thorough documentation and access to the
  https://gruntwork.io/training/[DevOps Training Library], a collection of video training courses that teach a variety
  of DevOps topics, including infrastructure as code, Terraform, Docker, Packer, AWS, GCP, security, and more.

Keep everything up to date::
  The Gruntwork team is constantly updating the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library with the latest best practices, new features,
  and bug fixes. Instead of spending months fighting with Terraform or Kubernetes updates, better infrastructure is just
  a version number bump away (see the monthly https://blog.gruntwork.io/tagged/gruntwork-newsletter[Gruntwork Newsletter]).

Get commercial support::
  Work with a team of DevOps experts who can help you set up your infrastructure, design highly available and
  scalable systems, automate your builds and deployments, troubleshoot issues, and avoid gotchas and pitfalls. Reach out
  to Gruntwork Support via Slack, email, and phone/video calls, get code reviews, prioritized bug fixes, and SLAs on
  response times.

== Core concepts

=== The Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library

The Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library is a collection of over 300,000 lines of reusable, battle-tested infrastructure code
that is organized into 40+ GitHub repos, some public and open source, and some private and only accessible to Gruntwork
customers. Each repo is focused on one type of infrastructure: e.g., there is one repo that contains code for deploying
and managing Kubernetes on AWS, one repo with code for deploying and managing the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash,
Kibana), one repo that contains a collection of CI / CD code, and so on.

The code in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library is written using a combination of:

Terraform::
  Used to define and manage most of the basic infrastructure, such as servers, databases, load balancers, and
  networking.

Go::
  Used to build cross-platform CLI applications (e.g., `ssh-grunt` is a Go app you can run on your EC2 instances to
  manage SSH access to those instances via IAM groups) and to write automated tests for all of the modules (using the
  open source Go library https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/[Terratest]).

Bash::
  Used for small scripts on Linux and macOS, including:
+
* _Install scripts_: used to install and configure a piece of software. Example: the `install-elasticsearch` script
  can be used to install Elasticsearch on Linux.
* _Run scripts_: used to run a piece of software, typically during boot. Example: you can execute the
  `run-elasticsearch` script while a server is booting to auto-discover other Elasticsearch nodes and bootstrap an
  Elasticsearch cluster.

Python::
  Used for more complicated scripts, especially those that need to run on other operating systems (e.g., Windows)
  and/or those that need to be called directly from Terraform (e.g., to fill in some missing functionality).

Helm::
  Used to define and manage Kubernetes applications and resources. Example: `k8s-service` is a helm chart that packages
  your application containers into a best practices deployment for Kubernetes.

Why these tools? We wrote a detailed blog post on
https://blog.gruntwork.io/why-we-use-terraform-and-not-chef-puppet-ansible-saltstack-or-cloudformation-7989dad2865c[why we use Terraform];
as for Go, Bash, and Python, we use them because they work just about everywhere, with few or no external dependencies,
and they can be integrated with almost any configuration management approach: e.g., you can use Bash scripts with Chef,
Puppet, Ansible, Packer, and Docker.

We use helm because it has a strong community (including official support from the https://www.cncf.io/[Cloud Native
Computing Foundation]) with many vendors officially packaging their applications into a Helm Chart (e.g. Hashicorp
uses Helm to package Vault and Consul for Kubernetes).

The code in each repo is organized into three primary folders, `modules` (or `charts` for Helm), `examples`, and `test`, as described in the
following sections.

=== Modules

.The modules folder of the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) repo
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-as-code-library/elk-modules.png[]

Each repo in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library contains a `modules` (or `charts`) folder that contains the main implementation code,
broken down into multiple standalone, orthogonal, reusable, highly configurable _modules_. For example, the ELK repo
(Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) isn't one giant module that deploys the entire ELK stack, but a bunch of separate
modules for installing, running, and deploying Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, Elastalert, Beats, Collectd, and so on.

This allows you to combine and compose the modules in many different permutations to fit your exact needs: e.g., some
use cases need only Elasticsearch, while others need the full ELK stack, and for those that use the full stack, you
may run each component in separate clusters in some environments (e.g., in prod, for high availability and scalability)
and all in a single cluster in other environments (e.g., in dev, to save money).

=== Examples

.The examples folder of the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) repo
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-as-code-library/elk-examples.png[]

Each repo in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library contains an `examples` folder that shows you how to assemble the modules
from the `modules` folder into different permutations. This lets you try the modules out in minutes, without having to
write a line of code. In other words, this is executable documentation.

=== Automated tests

.The test folder of the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) repo
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-as-code-library/elk-tests.png[]

Each repo in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library contains a `test` folder that contains automated tests for the examples in
the `examples` folder. These are mostly integration tests, which use
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/[Terratest] under the hood to deploy the examples into real environments
(e.g., real AWS and GCP accounts), validate that everything works, and then tear everything down.

For example, after every commit to the ELK repo, we spin up a dozen ELK clusters, perform a variety of validation steps
(e.g., read data, write data, access Kibana, etc.) and then tear it all down again. This is how we build confidence
that the code does what we say it does—and that it continues to do it over years of updates.

=== Versioning

.An example of all the versioned updates announced in the monthly Gruntwork Newsletter
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-as-code-library/newsletter.png[]

All of the code in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library is _versioned_. Every time we make a change, we put out a new
versioned release, and announce it in the monthly
https://blog.gruntwork.io/tagged/gruntwork-newsletter[Gruntwork Newsletter].

When you use the code from the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library (a topic we'll cover in <<how_to_use_the_catalog>>), you pin
yourself to a specific version of the code. That way, you are not accidentally affected by any subsequent changes in
the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library until you explicitly choose to pull those changes in. And when you do want to pull the
changes in, it's just a matter of bumping the version number!

We use version numbers of the form `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.3`), following the principles of
_https://semver.org[semantic versioning]_. In traditional semantic versioning, you increment the:

. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

However, much of the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library is built on Terraform, and as Terraform is still not at version `1.0.0`
(latest version as of August, 2019, was `0.12.6`), most of the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library is using `0.MINOR.PATCH`
version numbers. With `0.MINOR.PATCH`, the rules are a bit different, where you increment the:

. MINOR version when you make incompatible API changes
. PATCH version when you add backwards compatible functionality or bug fixes.

=== The Gruntwork Reference Architecture

.An example of the Gruntwork Reference Architecture
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-as-code-library/ref-arch-full.png[]

The https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/[Gruntwork Reference Architecture] is a production-grade, end-to-end
tech stack built on top of the modules from the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library.

What's included::
  The Reference Architecture includes just about everything the typical company needs: multiple environments, each
  configured with server orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), load balancers, databases, caches, network topology,
  monitoring, alerting, log aggregation, CI/CD, user management, secrets management, SSH management, VPN management, and
  much more. For a detailed walkthrough, see
  https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-build-an-end-to-end-production-grade-architecture-on-aws-part-1-eae8eeb41fec[How to Build an End to End Production-Grade Architecture on AWS].
  We wire all these pieces together according to your needs, deploy everything into your AWS or GCP accounts, and give
  you 100% of the code—all in about one day.

Opinionated code::
  Whereas the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library is relatively unopinionated, allowing you to combine and compose modules, tools,
  and approaches however you want ("à la carte"), the Gruntwork Reference Architecture is more opinionated, giving you a
  pre-defined, standardized set of modules, tools, and approaches to choose from ("prix fixe"). If the opinionated
  design of the Reference Architecture looks like a good fit for your company, you may wish to purchase it as a way to
  save months of having to wire everything together and deploy it yourself. If the opinionated design is not a good
  fit, then you can use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library directly instead.

[[production_grade_infra_checklist]]
=== The production-grade infrastructure checklist

The Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library is a collection of _production-grade infrastructure_—that is, the type of reliable,
secure, battle-tested infrastructure that you'd bet your company on. Every time you deploy something to production,
you're betting that your infrastructure won't fall over if traffic goes up; you're betting that your infrastructure
won't lose your data if there's an outage; you're betting that your infrastructure won't allow your data to be
compromised when hackers try to break in; and if these bets don't work out, your company may go out of business. That's
what's at stake when we talk about "production-grade."

Building production-grade infrastructure requires taking into account a long list of details, which we have captured in
_The Production-Grade Infrastructure Checklist_:

|===

Most other collections of infrastructure code (e.g., AWS Quick Starts, Bitnami Application Catalog,
the Terraform Registry, Ansible Galaxy, Chef Supermarket, etc) are useful for learning and example code, but they do
not take most of this checklist into account, and therefore are not a good fit for direct production use. On the other
hand, every module in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library goes through the production-grade checklist and is explicitly
designed for use directly in production.

=== Infrastructure as code

Everything in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library is designed to allow you to define your _infrastructure as code (IaC)_.
That is, instead of deploying infrastructure _manually_ (e.g., by clicking around a web page), the idea behind IaC is
to write code to define, provision, and manage your infrastructure. This has a number of benefits:

Self-service::
  Most teams that deploy code manually have a small number of sysadmins (often, just one) who are the only ones who
  know all the magic incantations to make the deployment work and are the only ones with access to production. This
  becomes a major bottleneck as the company grows. If your infrastructure is defined in code, then the entire
  deployment process can be automated, and developers can kick off their own deployments whenever necessary.

Speed and safety::
  If the deployment process is automated, it'll be significantly faster, since a computer can carry out the deployment
  steps far faster than a person; and safer, since an automated process will be more consistent, more repeatable, and
  not prone to manual error.

Documentation::
  Instead of the state of your infrastructure being locked away in a single sysadmin's head, you can represent the
  state of your infrastructure in source files that anyone can read. In other words, IaC acts as documentation,
  allowing everyone in the organization to understand how things work, even if the sysadmin goes on vacation.

Version control::
  You can store your IaC source files in version control, which means the entire history of your infrastructure is now
  captured in the commit log. This becomes a powerful tool for debugging issues, as any time a problem pops up, your
  first step will be to check the commit log and find out what changed in your infrastructure, and your second step may
  be to resolve the problem by simply reverting back to a previous, known-good version of your IaC code.

// TODO: could add screenshot here of GitHub PR with plan output and tests
Validation::
  If the state of your infrastructure is defined in code, then for every single change, you can perform a code review,
  run a suite of automated tests, and pass the code through static analysis tools, all practices that are known to
  significantly reduce the chance of defects.

Happiness::
  Deploying code and managing infrastructure manually is repetitive and tedious. Developers and sysadmins resent this
  type of work, as it involves no creativity, no challenge, and no recognition. You could deploy code perfectly for
  months, and no one will take notice—until that one day when you mess it up. That creates a stressful and unpleasant
  environment. IaC offers a better alternative that allows computers to do what they do best (automation) and
  developers to do what they do best (coding).

Reuse::
  You can package your infrastructure into reusable modules, so that instead of doing every deployment for every
  product in every environment from scratch, you can build on top of known, documented, battle-tested pieces. You
  can build these reusable modules yourself or use an existing collection of modules, such as the Gruntwork
  Infrastructure as Code Library.

Some of the main IaC tools you'll see used and referenced in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library are Terraform, Terragrunt,
Packer, Docker, and Helm, each of which we'll discuss in the next several sections.

[[terraform]]
=== Terraform

https://www.terraform.io[Terraform] is an open source _provisioning_ tool that allows you to define and manage as code a
wide variety of infrastructure (e.g., servers, load balancers, databases, network settings, and so on) across
a wide variety of _providers_ (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure). For example, here's some example Terraform code you can use to
deploy an EC2 instance (a virtual server) running Ubuntu 18.04 into the `us-east-2` region of AWS:

.terraform-example.tf
[source,hcl]
----
# Deploy to the us-east-2 region of AWS
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-2"
}

# Deploy an EC2 instance running Ubuntu 18.04
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
----

You can deploy this server by running `terraform init` and `terraform apply`. Check out the
https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-terraform-b3d32832baca[Comprehensive Guide to Terraform] for a
thorough introduction to the language.

A large percentage of the infrastructure code in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library is defined using Terraform. We even
wrote https://www.terraformupandrunning.com[the book] on it!

[[terraform_cloud_enterprise]]
=== Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise
https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/index.html[Terraform Cloud] and https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/index.html[Terraform Enterprise] are HashiCorp's commercial Terraform products. They include many additional features for Terraform, including plan and apply workflows with approvals, role-based access control for teams, policy as code using Sentinel, and more.


image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-as-code-library/tfc.png[]

The Gruntwork module library and open source tools are compatible with Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise.


=== Terragrunt

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt[Terragrunt] is a thin, open source wrapper for Terraform. It is designed to
fill in some missing features in Terraform, such as allowing you to define your Terraform backend configuration in
one `terragrunt.hcl` file, rather than having to copy/paste the same config over and over again:

.terragrunt.hcl
[source,hcl]
----
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "my-lock-table"
  }
}
----

Once you've created your `terragrunt.hcl` configuration, you can run all the usual Terraform commands, but with
`terragrunt` as the binary: e.g., `terragrunt plan`, `terragrunt apply`, `terragrunt destroy`. Check out
https://blog.gruntwork.io/terragrunt-how-to-keep-your-terraform-code-dry-and-maintainable-f61ae06959d8[Terragrunt: how to keep your Terraform code DRY and maintainable]
for a thorough introduction.

Note that while the Gruntwork Reference Architecture relies on Terragrunt as one of its opinionated tools, the
Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library does NOT require Terragrunt; you can use the Terraform modules in the Gruntwork
Infrastructure as Code Library with plain Terraform, Terraform Enterprise, Atlantis, Terragrunt, or any other tools you prefer.

[[packer]]
=== Packer

https://www.packer.io[Packer] is an open source tool you can use to define _machine images_ (e.g., VM
images, Docker images) as code. For example, here is how you can use Packer to define an Ubuntu 18.04 Amazon Machine
Image (AMI) that has Node.js installed:

.packer-example.json
[source,json]
----
{
  "builders": [{
    "type": "amazon-ebs",
    "region": "us-east-2",
    "source_ami": "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0",
    "instance_type": "t2.micro",
    "ssh_username": "ubuntu",
    "ami_name": "packer-example-{{timestamp}}"
  }],
  "provisioners": [{
    "type": "shell",
    "inline": [
      "curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -",
      "sudo apt-get update -y",
      "sudo apt-get install -y nodejs"
    ]
  }]
}
----

You can run `packer build packer-example.json` to build an AMI from this code and then deploy this AMI to your AWS
account using other tools. For example, the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library contains several Terraform modules that can
deploy AMIs across one or more servers (e.g., into an AWS Auto Scaling Group), with support for auto scaling, auto
healing, zero-downtime deployments, etc.

The Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library contains a number of scripts and binaries that you can run on your servers: e.g., the
ELK code includes scripts you run during boot on Elasticsearch servers to bootstrap the cluster, and the security code
includes an `ssh-grunt` binary you can run on each server to manage SSH access to that server using IAM groups (i.e.,
IAM users in specific IAM groups will be able to SSH to specific servers using their own usernames and SSH keys).

To get these scripts and binaries onto your virtual servers (e.g., onto EC2 instances in AWS or compute instances in
GCP), we recommend using Packer to build VM images that have these scripts and binaries installed. You'll see an
example of how to do this in <<how_to_use_the_catalog>>. Note that Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library does NOT require that
you use Packer (e.g., you could also use Ansible or Chef to install the scripts and binaries), but the Gruntwork
Reference Architecture does use Packer as one of its opinionated tools.

[[docker]]
=== Docker

https://www.docker.com[Docker] is an open source tool you can use to run _containers_ and define _container images_ as
code. A container is a bit like a lightweight VM, except instead of virtualizing all the hardware and the entire
operating system, containers virtualize solely user space, which gives you many of the isolation benefits of a VM
(each container is isolated in terms of memory, CPU, networking, hard drive, etc), but with much less memory, CPU, and
start-up time overhead. For example, here is how you can define an Ubuntu 18.04 Docker image that has Node.js installed:

.Dockerfile
[source,Dockerfile]
----
FROM ubuntu:18.04

RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash - && \
    sudo apt-get update -y && \
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
----

You can run `docker build -t example-image .` to build a Docker image from this code, push the image to a Docker
Registry (e.g., ECR or Docker Hub), and then deploy the Docker image using other tools. For example, the Gruntwork
Infrastructure as Code Library contains a number of modules for running _container orchestration tools_ such as Kubernetes, ECS, and
Nomad that you can use to deploy and manage Docker images.

[[helm]]
=== Helm

https://helm.sh/[Helm] is a package and module manager for Kubernetes that allows you to define, install, and manage
Kubernetes applications as reusable packages called _Charts_. Helm provides support for official charts in their
repository that contains various applications such as Jenkins, MySQL, and Consul to name a few.

Charts are written in go templates and allow templatization of Kubernetes manifests to allow deployment across varying
inputs. This allows vendors to simplify distribution of their applications for Kubernetes so that users can deploy and
upgrade their application in a single command.

Each vendor distributes their charts using _chart repositories_, which is a server that serves chart packages. You can
access any chart in a repository once you add it to your local configuration.

For example, you can use the helm client to add the official Elastic repository to install ElasticSearch onto Kubernetes:

[source,bash]
----
helm repo add elastic https://helm.elastic.co
helm install elastic/elasticsearch
----

The Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library contains a number of Helm charts that help you manage your deployments of
your applications: e.g the `k8s-service` helm chart packages your application containers into a best practices
deployment for managing on Kubernetes. You can access the Gruntwork Helm charts by adding the Gruntwork Helm Chart
Repository. You will see an example of how to do this in <<how_to_use_the_catalog>>.


[[immutable_infrastructure]]
=== Immutable infrastructure

With _mutable infrastructure_, you deploy a set of servers, and you continuously update those servers in place. Every
new update gets installed on top of the previous updates, either manually (e.g., by SSHing to each server and running
commands), or via tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet. The idea behind _immutable infrastructure_ is that once you
deploy a server, you never change it again. If you need to roll out an update, you deploy a _new_ server with that
update, and undeploy the old one. This paradigm is built for use with (a) the cloud, where you can easily spin up or
tear down servers on-demand and (b) machine images, as every time there's a change, you can use tools like Packer or
Docker to build a new, immutable, versioned machine image (e.g., VM image or Docker image), and deploy new servers with
that image.

The advantages of immutable infrastructure are:

Easier to reason about servers::
  With mutable infrastructure, each server builds up a unique history of changes, so each one is a little different,
  which (a) makes it difficult to reason about what's actually installed and (b) leads to tricky bugs that only show up
  on some servers, and not on others. With immutable infrastructure, you avoid these sorts of bugs, and you always know
  what's installed on any server, as you know the exact image each server is running, and that the image never changes.

You can run the same images in all environments::
  Whereas it's rare to run mutable infrastructure tools such as Ansible, Chef, or Puppet in your local dev environment,
  it's common to run the same Docker or VM image in all environments, including your laptop, staging, and production.
  This helps to reduce "works on my machine" and environment-specific bugs, and makes it easier to debug those issues
  when they do happen.

Easier scaling and rollback::
  With immutable images, you can quickly and easily spin up 100 or 1,000 servers, with no need to worry about how long
  it'll take to configure all those servers (e.g., via Ansible, Chef, or Puppet), as all the configuration has already
  happened and is captured in the VM or Docker image. Rollback is easier too, as you can quickly jump back to a
  previous image, without having to wait for and worry about running a bunch of older install commands (which may no
  longer work, e.g., if certain packages have been removed from APT or YUM).

[[how_to_use_the_catalog]]
== How to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library

With all the core concepts out of the way, let's now discuss how to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library to build
production-grade infrastructure.

=== Learning resources

The first step is to learn! You'll need to learn about your chosen cloud (e.g., AWS or GCP), infrastructure (e.g., VPCs,
Kubernetes, Kafka, ELK), tools (e.g., Terraform, Docker, Packer), and DevOps practices (e.g., CI, CD). Here are some
useful resources:

. https://gruntwork.io/training/[Gruntwork DevOps Training Library]: a collection of video training courses that teach
  a variety of DevOps topics, such as infrastructure as code, Terraform, Docker, Packer, AWS, GCP, security, and more.
. https://gruntwork.io/guides/[Gruntwork Production Deployment Guides]: a collection of guides that do step-by-step
  walkthroughs of how to go to production. You're reading one now!
. https://gruntwork.io/devops-resources/[Gruntwork DevOps Resources]: a collection of blog posts, talks, books, and
  checklists for learning about DevOps, AWS, Terraform, Docker, Packer, and more.

[[get_access]]
=== Get access to the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library

The next step is to get access to the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library.

. To get access, you must become a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscriber#.
. As part of the sign up process, we'll ask for your GitHub user ID. The Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library lives in 40+ GitHub
  repos, most of them private, so you'll need to send us a GitHub user ID so we can grant you access. If you don't
  already have a GitHub user, you can create one for free on http://github.com/[github.com].
. If you haven't already, create an SSH key, add it to `ssh-agent`, and associate it with your GitHub user
  (https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent[instructions]).
  You'll need a working SSH key to access Terraform modules in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library (you'll see examples of
  this later in the guide).
. If you haven't already, create a GitHub personal access token
  (https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line[instructions]). You'll
  need a working GitHub personal access token to access scripts and binaries in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library (you'll
  see examples of this later in the guide).

=== Find the modules you want to use

The next step is to find the modules you want to use. Head over to the
https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library] and find the repos that you wish to
use. Browse the `modules` folder each the repo to see what modules are available and the `examples` folders to see the
various ways to combine those modules. You can also browse the <<example_ref_arch, example Reference Architecture>>
to find production-grade code to use as a starting point.

Within the Infrastructure as Code Library, you'll find two types of modules: (1) Terraform modules and (2) scripts and binaries. The
next two sections of the guide will walk you through how to use each of these.

[[using_terraform_modules]]
=== Using Terraform Modules

This section will show you how to use Terraform modules from the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library. As an illustrative example,
we'll deploy the `vpc-app` Terraform module from https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc[terraform-aws-vpc], using the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/master/modules/networking/vpc[`vpc` service
module] from the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog[`terraform-aws-service-catalog` repo].

[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: You must be a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscriber# to access `terraform-aws-vpc` and `terraform-aws-service-catalog`.

You can use these modules to deploy a production-grade VPC on AWS. For full background information on VPCs, check
out link:/guides/networking/how-to-deploy-production-grade-vpc-aws[How to deploy a production-grade VPC on AWS].

==== Get to know the Service Catalog module

The Terraform modules in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library are intentionally designed to be unopinionated, so they do not
configure `provider` or `backend` settings. Moreover, you will often use multiple modules from the Infrastructure as Code Library,
rather than just one at a time. Therefore, the canonical way to consume a Terraform module from the Gruntwork
Infrastructure as Code Library is to use the _Service Catalog_ module from the Gruntwork `terraform-aws-service-catalog` repo.

Take a look at the `vpc-app` wrapper module (_service module_) to get familiar with how this module uses the underlying `vpc-app`
module from `terraform-aws-vpc`.

----
terraform-aws-service-catalog
  └ modules
    └ networking
      └ vpc
        └ README.md
        └ main.tf
        └ outputs.tf
        └ variables.tf
----

==== Terraform and providers are configured

The service catalog module's `main.tf` file configures the Terraform providers to use. Since the `vpc-app` module in
this guide is an AWS module, it configures the AWS provider in the configuration of Terraform itself in `main.tf`:

.terraform-aws-service-catalog/modules/networking/vpc/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
terraform {
  required_version: ">= 0.12.26"

  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 2.69"
    }
  }
}
----

This does the following:

Pin the AWS provider version::
  This pins the AWS provider version, ensuring that you always get AWS provider version `2.x` and won't accidentally get
  version `3.x` in the future, which would be backward incompatible. We recommend pinning the versions for all
  providers you're using.

Pin the Terraform version::
  The code above will ONLY allow you to run it with a specific Terraform version. This is a safety measure to ensure
  you don't accidentally pick up a new version of Terraform until you're ready. This is important because (a) Terraform
  is a pre 1.0.0 tool, so even patch version number bumps (e.g., `0.12.6` -> `0.12.7`) are sometimes backwards
  incompatible or buggy and (b) once you've upgraded to a newer version, Terraform will no longer allow you to deploy
  that code with any older version. For example, if a single person on your team upgrades to `0.12.7` and runs `apply`,
  then you'll no longer be able to use the state file with `0.12.6`, and you'll be forced to upgrade everyone on your
  team and all your CI servers to `0.12.7`. It's best to do this explicitly, rather than accidentally, so we recommend
  pinning Terraform versions.


Let's look at the corresponding input variables in `variables.tf`. You'll provide values for these when you start using the
module in the next section.

.terraform-aws-service-catalog/modules/networking/vpc/variables.tf
[source,hcl]
----
variable "aws_region" {
  description = "The AWS region in which all resources will be created"
  type        = string
}

variable "vpc_name" {
  description = "Name of the VPC. Examples include 'prod', 'dev', 'mgmt', etc."
  type        = string
}

variable "cidr_block" {
  description = "The IP address range of the VPC in CIDR notation. A prefix of /18 is recommended. Do not use a prefix higher than /27. Examples include '10.100.0.0/18', '10.200.0.0/18', etc."
  type        = string
}

variable "num_nat_gateways" {
  description = "The number of NAT Gateways to launch for this VPC. For production VPCs, a NAT Gateway should be placed in each Availability Zone (so likely 3 total), whereas for non-prod VPCs, just one Availability Zone (and hence 1 NAT Gateway) will suffice."
  type        = number
}

# Plus many more optional variables...

----

==== Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library modules are referenced

The service catalog module now pulls in the Terraform modules you want from the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code
Library as follows:

.terraform-aws-service-catalog/modules/networking/vpc/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
module "vpc" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest terraform-aws-vpc release
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc.git//modules/vpc-app?ref=<VERSION>"

  vpc_name               = var.vpc_name
  aws_region             = var.aws_region
  tenancy                = var.tenancy
  num_availability_zones = var.num_availability_zones
  num_nat_gateways       = var.num_nat_gateways
  cidr_block             = var.cidr_block

  # Plus many more configurations...
}
----

This code does the following:

Terraform module support::
  This code pulls in a module using Terraform's native `module` functionality. For background info, see
  https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-create-reusable-infrastructure-with-terraform-modules-25526d65f73d[How to create reusable infrastructure with Terraform modules].

SSH Git URL::
  The `source` URL in the code above uses a Git URL with SSH authentication (see
  https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html[module sources] for all the types of `source` URLs you can use).
  If you followed the SSH instructions in <<get_access>>, this will allow you to access private repos in the Gruntwork
  Infrastructure as Code Library without having to hard-code a password in your Terraform code.

Versioned URL::
  Note the `?ref=<VERSION>` at the end of the `source` URL. This parameter allows you to pull in a specific version of
  each module so that you don't accidentally pull in (potentially backwards incompatible code) in the future. You
  should replace `<VERSION>` with the latest version from the releases page of the repo you're using (e.g., here's
  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-vpc/releases[the releases page for module-vpc]).

Module arguments::
  Below the `source` URL, you'll need to pass in the module-specific arguments. You can find all the required and
  optional variables defined in `variables.tf` (new name) of the module (e.g.,
  here's https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc/blob/master/modules/vpc-app/vars.tf[the variables.tf for vpc-app]).
  The code above sets these to input variables (which you'll define shortly) so that you can use different values in
  different environments.

Familiarize yourself with the output variables in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/blob/master/modules/networking/vpc/outputs.tf[`outputs.tf`]:


[[automated_tests_terraform]]
==== Automated tests for Terraform code

The underlying library module is tested within https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc/tree/master/test[`terraform-aws-vpc`] itself, and the service catalog
module is tested within the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/blob/master/test/networking/vpc_test.go[`terraform-aws-service-catalog`
`vpc_test`].

You can learn how to run these tests by reading the instructions in library module https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc/tree/master/test[here].

We run these automated tests for all modules. Automated tests for infrastructure code spin up and
tear down a lot of infrastructure, so we use a separate _testing environment_ (e.g. yet another AWS account) for
running automated tests—separate even from the sandboxes we use for manual testing. We run https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke[cloud-nuke] on a schedule to periodically clean up left-over resources in
the testing environment (e.g., delete all resources that are older than 24h).

Thus we provide you the confidence you need that your infrastructure code works as you expect, because we deploy it into a real AWS
account, with _integration tests_ that:

. Run `terraform apply` to deploy the module
. Perform a bunch of validations that the deployed infrastructure works as expected
. Run `terraform destroy` at the end to clean up

In short, we've automated the steps you previously might have had to take to manually test your modules!

You can make it easier to write tests of this format by leveraging https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/[Terratest],
an open source Go library that contains helpers for testing many types of infrastructure code, including Terraform,
Packer, and Docker.

For example, we've created a https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc/blob/master/test/vpc_app_test.go[`vpc_app_test.go`]
that tests the `vpc-app` library module. Here's the directory structure
that you'll see in this library module, as well as all other Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library modules:

----
terraform-aws-vpc
  └ modules
    └ networking
      └ vpc-app
        └ main.tf
        └ outputs.tf
        └ variables.tf
        └ testing
          └ terraform.tfvars
          └ backend.hcl
  └ test
    └ vpc_app_test.go
----

Check out the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/#quickstart[Terratest install instructions] for how to
configure your environment for Go and install Terratest.

Here's a look at the test code in `vpc_app_test.go`:

.terraform-aws-vpc/test/vpc_app_test.go
[source,go]
----
package test

import (
    "testing"

    "fmt"
    "github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/random"
    "github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestVpcApp(t *testing.T) {
  	// Run this test in parallel with all the others
    t.Parallel()

    awsRegion := pickRandomAwsRegion(t)

    // Generates Terraform Options such as region, account_id, etc.
    terraformOptions := createVpcAppTerratestOptions(t, awsRegion)

    // Be sure to clean up resources so they do not accrue cost.
    defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)

	  // Run 'terraform init' and 'terraform apply' to deploy the module
    terraform.InitAndApply(t, terraformOptions)

    // Check for perpetual diff
    assert.Equal(t, 0, terraform.InitAndPlanWithExitCode(t, terraformOptions))

    expectedCidrBlocks := []string{"10.0.240.0/24", "10.0.241.0/24", "10.0.242.0/24", "10.0.243.0/24", "10.0.244.0/24", "10.0.245.0/24"}
    validateSubnetsConfiguredForCIDRBlocks(t, "private_persistence_subnet_ids", expectedCidrBlocks, terraformOptions, awsRegion)
}

func createVpcAppTerratestOptions(t *testing.T, awsRegion string) *terraform.Options {
    // Create options based on a base set of Terraform Options (see helper function in test folder)
    terratestOptions := createBaseTerraformOptions(t, templatesVPCAppPath, awsRegion)

	  // Generate a unique name for each VPC so tests running in parallel don't clash
    terratestOptions.Vars["vpc_name"] = fmt.Sprintf("Prod%s", random.UniqueId())
    return terratestOptions
}
----

The test code above implements a test that does the following:

Configure variables::
  This is similar to the `testing/terraform.tfvars` you would use in manual testing.

Namespace resources::
  The code uses `random.UniqueId()` to generate unique identifiers for all the resources in this test. This allows
  multiple tests to run in parallel (e.g., on your computer, your teammates' computers, CI servers) without running
  into conflicts (e.g., without conflicts over resources that require unique names, such as VPCs).

Defer terraform destroy::
  The test code uses `defer` to schedule `terraform.Destroy` to run at the end of the test, whether or not the test
  passes.

terraform init and apply::
  The test runs `terraform init` and `terraform apply` on the module. If this hits any errors, the test will fail.

This is a complete production-grade test that not only ensures your module can deploy and undeploy successfully; it
also validates VPCs by launching EC2 instances in various subnets and ensures that connections between some subnets
work, and others are blocked, based on the networking settings in that VPC.

To run the test, authenticate to your testing environment and do the following:

[source,bash]
----
cd terraform-aws-vpc/test
go test -v -timeout 45m
----

Note the use of the `-timeout 45m` argument with `go test`. By default, Go imposes a time limit of 10 minutes for
tests, after which it forcibly kills the test run, causing the tests to not only fail, but even preventing the cleanup
code (i.e., `terraform destroy`) from running. This VPC test should take closer to ten minutes, but whenever running a
Go test that deploys real infrastructure, it's safer to set an extra long timeout to avoid the test being killed part
way through and leaving all sorts of infrastructure still running.

For a lot more information on writing automated tests for Terraform code, see:

. https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/[Terratest documentation], especially the many examples and corresponding
  tests in the `examples` and `test` folders, respectively, and the
  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/#testing-best-practices[testing best practices] section.
. _https://www.terraformupandrunning.com[Terraform: Up & Running]_, 2nd edition, has an entire chapter dedicated to
  automated testing for Terraform code, including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, dependency injection,
  running tests in parallel, test stages, and more.

[[deploy_terraform]]
==== Deploying Terraform code

Now that your module has been thoroughly tested, you can deploy it to your real environments (e.g., staging and
production). There are many ways to deploy Terraform modules, so in this guide, we'll focus on just the following ones:

. <<deploy_using_plain_terraform>>
. <<deploy_using_terragrunt>>

// TODO: add Terraform Enterprise instructions

[[deploy_using_plain_terraform]]
===== Deploy using plain Terraform

One option is to deploy all of your environments using plain-old-Terraform. Let's walk through it for the staging environment.

First, create a `staging/terraform.tfvars` file:

----
infrastructure-modules
  └ networking
    └ vpc-app
      └ main.tf
      └ outputs.tf
      └ variables.tf
      └ testing
        └ terraform.tfvars
        └ backend.hcl
      └ staging
        └ terraform.tfvars
  └ test
    └ vpc_app_test.go
----

Inside the file, set the variables for this module to values appropriate for this environment:

.infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc-app/staging/terraform.tfvars
[source,hcl]
----
aws_region       = "us-east-2"
aws_account_id   = "888888888888"
vpc_name         = "staging-vpc"
cidr_block       = "10.10.0.0/16"
num_nat_gateways = 1
----

Next, create a `staging/backend.hcl` file:

----
infrastructure-modules
  └ networking
    └ vpc-app
      └ main.tf
      └ outputs.tf
      └ variables.tf
      └ testing
        └ terraform.tfvars
        └ backend.hcl
      └ staging
        └ terraform.tfvars
        └ backend.hcl
  └ test
    └ vpc_app_test.go
----

Inside this file, configure the backend for staging:

.infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc-app/staging/backend.hcl
[source,hcl]
----
bucket         = "<YOUR-BUCKET-FOR-STAGING>"
key            = "networking/vpc-app/terraform.tfstate"
region         = "us-east-2"
encrypt        = true
dynamodb_table = "<DYNAMODB-TABLE-FOR-STAGING>"
----

And now you can deploy to the staging environment as follows:

[source,bash]
----
cd infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc-app/staging
terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl ../
terraform apply ../
----

To deploy to other environments, create analogous `.tfvars` and `.hcl` files (e.g., `production/terraform.tfvars` and
`production/backend.hcl`) and run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` with those files.

*Benefits of this approach*

* No external tooling required.
* Analogous to how you run manual and automated tests.
* Quick feedback cycle.
* Completely free and open source.

*Drawbacks to this approach*

* You're always deploying "latest" from a branch. No versioning or easy rollback.
* Lots of command-line arguments to pass. Easy to make mistakes. Most teams end up creating hacky wrapper scripts.
* Lots of backend configuration to copy for each module. Manually setting a unique `key` for each module is repetitive
  and error prone.
* From a quick glance at the code, it's not clear what accounts, environments, or regions you deploy to. Figuring this
  out requires digging through many folders.

[[deploy_using_terragrunt]]
===== Deploy using Terragrunt

Another option is to use https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt[Terragrunt], an open source wrapper for Terraform
that helps alleviate some of the drawbacks mentioned in the previous approach.

With Terragrunt, we recommend defining your live environments in a separate repo called `infrastructure-live`
that uses a folder structure with the following format:

----
infrastructure-live
  └ <account>
    └ terragrunt.hcl
    └ _global
    └ <region>
      └ _regional
      └ <environment>
        └ <resource>
          └ terragrunt.hcl
----

Where:

<account>::
  A the top level, you have accounts (e.g., an AWS account) or projects (e.g., GCP project).

<region>::
  Within each account, there will be one or more regions (e.g., in AWS, `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`, etc). There may also
  be a `_global` folder that defines resources that are available across all the regions in this account, such as
  IAM users and DNS settings. Each account also has a root `terragrunt.hcl` file that defines common Terraform settings
  that apply to the entire account, such as what backend to use to store Terraform state.

<environment>::
  Within each region, there will be one or more environments, such as dev, stage, prod, mgmt, etc. There may also be a
  `_regional` folder that defines resources that are available across all the environments in this region.

<resource>::
  Within each environment, you use Terraform modules to deploy one or more resources, such as servers, databases load
  balancers, and so on. Each module is configured via a `terragrunt.hcl` file.

For example, if you were using AWS, with separate accounts for staging and production (see
link:/guides/foundations/how-to-configure-production-grade-aws-account-structure[How to Configure a Production Grade AWS Account Structure]),
and you wanted to deploy the `vpc-app` module in the `us-east-2` region in
each of these accounts, the folder structure would look like this:

----
infrastructure-live
  └ common.hcl
  └ terragrunt.hcl
  └ staging
    └ terragrunt.hcl
    └ us-east-2
      └ stage
         └ networking
           └ vpc-app
             └ terragrunt.hcl
  └ production
    └ terragrunt.hcl
    └ us-east-2
      └ prod
        └ networking
          └ vpc-app
            └ terragrunt.hcl
----

[NOTE]
.Environments within accounts
====
In the folder structure above, it may seem redundant to have an environment, such as `stage`, within an account, such
as `staging`. However, in real-world usage, it's common to have multiple environments within a single account. For
example, within the `staging` account, you may have not just a `stage` environment, which contains the VPC and some
applications, but also a `mgmt` environment, which contains a separate VPC for running DevOps tooling (e.g., an OpenVPN
server).
====

The `terragrunt.hcl` in the root of `infrastructure-live` defines the backend settings for all accounts (including special
helpers to automatically set the `key` value). Here's an example of how a
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/blob/master/examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/terragrunt.hcl[`terragrunt.hcl`]
might look. It references common variables that are set in the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/blob/master/examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/common.hcl[`common.hcl`]
file also at the root of `infrastructure-live`. Also important is the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/blob/master/examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/stage/account.hcl[`account.hcl`]
file at the root of each account, which sets the `account_name` and `domain_name` variables if applicable.

The `terragrunt.hcl` for each child module within an account specifies what module to deploy—including the version to
use—and sets the variables to values appropriate for that environment. Take a look at what the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/blob/master/examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/stage/us-west-2/stage/networking/vpc/terragrunt.hcl[`terragrunt.hcl`]
file looks like for the staging environment for the `vpc` module.

To deploy `vpc-app` in staging, you do the following:

[source,bash]
----
cd infrastructure-live/staging/us-east-2/stage/vpc
terragrunt apply
----

When you run this command, Terragrunt will:

. Checkout the `terraform-aws-service-catalog` repo at the current version into a scratch directory.
. Run `terraform init` in the scratch directory, configuring the backend to the values in the root `terragrunt.hcl`.
. Run `terraform apply` in the scratch directory, configuring the variables to the values in the `inputs = { ... }`
  block.

You can deploy the production environment by creating an analogous
`infrastructure-live/production/us-east-2/prod/vpc/terragrunt.hcl` file and running `terragrunt apply` in
`infrastructure-live/production/us-east-2/prod/vpc/`. If you have multiple modules and you want to deploy all of
them, you can use `terragrunt apply-all`. For example, to deploy _everything_ in the production account, you would
do the following:

[source,bash]
----
cd infrastructure-live/production
terragrunt apply-all
----

*Benefits of this approach*

* All your code is versioned. You can deploy different versions in different environments, and roll back to older
  versions if necessary.
* Backend configuration is DRY. No more copy/pasting values, no more manually setting `key` for each module.
* CLI arguments are DRY. No need for long commands or extra wrapper scripts.
* The full structure of all accounts, environments, and regions is visible at a glance in the `infrastructure-live`
  repo.
* Completely free and open source.
* Deploy multiple modules using `apply-all`.

*Drawbacks to this approach*

* You have to install, learn, and manage a new tool / abstraction layer.
* The scratch directory can make debugging/troubleshooting tricky.

==== Updating

Now that you have your Terraform module deployed, you can pull in updates as follows:

. Subscribe to the monthly https://blog.gruntwork.io/tagged/gruntwork-newsletter[Gruntwork Newsletter] to be notified
  of all updates to the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library. Alternatively, you can "watch" repos in GitHub that you're
  interested in.
. Pull in updates to the Gruntwork AWS Service Catalog whenever they are posted. For example, when we make improvements to
  the `terraform-aws-vpc` modules, we will cut a new release with a new tag. At the same time, we release a new version of the
  AWS Service Catalog (`terraform-aws-service-catalog`) so that _its_ `vpc` module references that new version. All you have
  to do is pull in the new service catalog module version into your `infrastructure-live` repo. For example, if you were
  using `terraform-aws-service-catalog` at `v0.51.3` and you wanted to update to `v0.51.4`, you would change from:
+
[source,hcl]
----
terraform {
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog.git//modules/networking/vpc?ref=v0.51.3"
}
----
+
to:
+
[source,hcl]
----
terraform {
  source = "ggit::it@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog.git//modules/networking/vpc?ref=v0.51.4"
}
----
. Pay close attention to the release notes for any additional instructions. In particular, if the MINOR version number
  was increased (e.g., `v0.6.0` -> `v0.7.0`), that implies a backward incompatible change, and the release notes will
  explain what you need to do (e.g., you might have to add, remove, or change arguments you pass to the module).
. Tests your changes locally. You do this using the same process outlined in <<manual_tests_terraform>> and
  <<automated_tests_terraform>>.
. Deploy your changes to each environment. You do this using the same process outlined in <<deploy_terraform>>.

[[integration_with_tfc_tfe]]
=== Integrating with Terraform Cloud and Enterprise
This section will cover how to use Gruntwork in conjunction with two popular HashiCorp products: https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/index.html[Terraform Cloud (TFC)] and https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/index.html[Terraform Enterprise (TFE)]. Although the open source edition of Terraform is quite powerful and flexible as a standalone project, many organizations turn to TFC/TFE for the CLI/UI integration, approval-based workflow capabilities, Sentinel policy framework, and more. At its core, Terraform Enterprise is basically Terraform Cloud repackaged for a self-hosted environment. We'll use "TFC" as short hand for both Terraform Cloud and Enterprise throughout this guide.

In the sections above, we discussed how to use Gruntwork with two VCS repositories: `infrastructure-modules`, containing your Terraform code that wraps the modules from Gruntwork Library, and `infrastructure-live`, containing Terragrunt configurations that enable you to manage Terraform easily across multiple accounts and environments. When using Gruntwork with TFC, you have two choices regarding these repositories:

Use TFC without Terragrunt::
  Using this approach, Terraform modules are still defined in an `infrastructure-modules` repository as discussed above.
  Each module has a dedicated https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/workspaces.html[TFC workspace]. You create the
  workspace in advance, and then you can run the Terraform modules either from the `terraform` CLI or from the TFC UI.
  In essence, TFC replaces Terragrunt and `infrastructure-live`. You'll be able to use the full TFC feature set, but you
  won't be able to take advantage of the benefits provided by Terragrunt, such as keeping your code and variables, CLI
  args, etc DRY, and adding support for applying changes across multiple modules / environments.

Use TFC with Terragrunt::
  Alternatively, you can use both `infrastructure-modules` and `infrastructure-live` repositories as described above,
  storing the wrapper modules in `infrastructure-modules`, and using `infrastructure-live` and Terragrunt for
  deployments. In this approach, TFC is used as a https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/remote.html[remote backend]
  for Terraform. You use Terragrunt to run deployments from the CLI, which in turn invokes Terraform on the TFC backend.
  The TFC UI is used for audit and tracking capabilities, but not for executing Terraform runs.

We cover each approach below, but first, you'll need to complete a few one time set up steps.

==== One time set up

[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: If you're using TFE, you'll need to follow https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/before-installing/index.html[HashiCorp's Enterprise installation instructions] first. Most of the details below still apply to TFE, but you should adjust any URLs, such as `app.terraform.io`, to use your TFE installation instead.

===== Create an account

The first step is to establish an account. Visit https://app.terraform.io/signup/account[the Terraform Cloud sign up page] to create a free account.

.Sign up for a Terraform Cloud account
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-as-code-library/tfc-sign-up.png[]


===== Create an organization

Once the account is established, you'll verify your email address. It's safe to skip the initial set up instructions.
After doing so, you'll be presented with the option to create a new organization. We suggest using lowercase
organization names, optionally with `-` or `_` characters, but without whitespace.

.Create an organization in TFC
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-as-code-library/tfc-create-organization.png[]

===== Set up an SSH key

When you're using Gruntwork modules, you use the source attribute on a module block to read a module from a Gruntwork
code repository. As a simple example, if you wanted to create an SQS queue using the SQS module from https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-messaging[`package-messaging`], you might create something like the following:

[source,hcl]
----
provider "aws" {
 region = "us-east-1"
}

module "sns" {
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/package-messaging.git//modules/sqs?ref=v0.3.2"
  name   = "my-queue"
}
----

The `git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io` portion of the `source` attribute indicates that this module is accessed over SSH. Thus, TFC will need access to the Gruntwork code repositories via SSH.

To set up this access, take the following steps:

. First, if you don't have one already, you'll need a machine user that has access to Gruntwork. A machine user is an
account that is only used for automation, and is not used by humans. In this case, the "machine" in question is the TFC
executor. Create a new Github user, and send the machine user's username and email address to link:mailto:support@gruntwork.io[support@gruntwork.io]. We'll make sure the user has access to our repositories.
. Next, generate an SSH key pair, and add the public key to the new GitHub machine user. GitHub has https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.19/user/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh[easy-to-follow instructions].
. Now, add the private SSH key to TFC. You'll find the option under SSH Keys in the TFC organization settings. We called ours _Gruntwork access_. TFC will use this key to clone Gruntwork code repositories.

.Configuring an SSH key for the TFC organization
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-as-code-library/tfc_ssh_key.png[]


With the SSH key in place, the one time set up is complete.


==== Using TFC without Terragrunt

This section will demonstrate how to use TFC to deploy your infrastructure, leveraging Gruntwork's Terraform modules to do the heavy lifting. With this method, you can run Terraform from your local CLI or from the TFC UI.

https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/workspaces.html[Workspaces] store the state
associated with the infrastructure that is managed by Terraform. The state is
stored in TFC. You can use the
https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/terraform/d/remote_state.html[`remote_state`
data source] to use the outputs of one workspace as the variable inputs for
another workspace. In this manner, you can link multiple workspaces together to
build an end-to-end infrastructure.

In the <<using_terraform_modules>> section, we discussed the wrapper module
pattern in which multiple Terraform modules are contained in a hierarchy of directories located under
`infrastructure-modules/modules`. Using such a hierarchy, each workspace will use the same `infrastructure-modules` repository, but pointed at different subdirectories within the repository.

We'll demonstrate how to set up a workspace for a simple SQS module. To get started, create a new workspace and connect in to your VCS provider.

===== Connect to a version control provider
Connect the workspace to the version control system of your choice. For example, GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. This allows TFC to access your `infrastructure-modules` repository. Once your VCS is connected, select your `infrastructure-modules` repository from the list of repositories presented.

.Connect a workspace to a VCS
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-as-code-library/tfc-create-workspace.png[]


===== Configure the workspace settings

In this step, you'll choose a name and configure additional settings relating to the workspace. Be sure to
https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/workspaces/naming.html[follow the workspace naming guidelines] to ensure a
consistent yet flexible naming convention. For this example, we'll choose `sqs-example-dev-us-east-1`.

We also need to inform TFC where to find the correct module. Under the
_Advanced options_, locate the _Terraform Working Directory_ field, and enter
the path to the module. TFC will automatically enter the same value for
_Automatic Run Triggering_ to ensure that Terraform runs for this workspace
only occur when changes are detected to the module path. For our SQS example,
we enter the value `/modules/networking/sqs`.

.Configure workspace settings
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-as-code-library/tfc-workspace-settings.png[]


===== Use the SSH key

In the one time set up steps described above, you created an SSH key. You'll now need to choose this SSH key in the workspace settings.

.Choose the private SSH key
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-as-code-library/tfc-workspace-ssh.png[]

[[configure_credentials_and_variables]]
===== Configure credentials and variables

The Terraform AWS provider used by the SQS module will need credentials to communicate with the AWS API. You can set this up using the standard `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables in the workspace. When setting the variables, be sure to mark the _Sensitive_ checkbox so that the variables are write only.

.Configure AWS API credentials as environment variables in the workspace
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-as-code-library/tfc-env-vars.png[]
{empty} +

You can also enter values for any Terraform variables for the module. For our simple SQS module we don't define any variables.

===== Queue and apply the configuration

With all the configuration complete, it's time to kick off the plan and apply. You can trigger the run by making a
commit to a file in the working directory that you set up when configuring workspace settings (in our case, in
`/modules/networking/sqs`), or by manually triggering the run using the _Queue plan_ button in the TFC UI. The run will:

* Clone your `infrastructure-modules` repository using the VCS connection
* Download the AWS provider and set credentials using the environment variables
* Download the Gruntwork SQS module using the SSH key
* Run a `terraform plan`
* Wait for confirmation
* Once confirmed, run a `terraform apply`

.TFC run results
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-as-code-library/tfc-run.png[]

===== Final thoughts on integrating TFC with the Gruntwork library

It's easy to use TFC with the Gruntwork library. When using the `infrastructure-modules` approach outlined in this
guide, all of your Terraform wrapper modules will be in one place. You can configure one workspace per module, and you
can link modules together with the https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/terraform/d/remote_state.html[`remote_state`
data source]. Note that you'll need to set up the AWS credentials and SSH key within each workspace.

You can use this pattern for any of Gruntwork's Terraform modules. This even works for modules like
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks[`terraform-aws-eks`] which need to download external dependencies (like
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt[`kubergrunt`]). Those modules use the special
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-terraform-utilities/tree/master/modules/executable-dependency[`executable-dependency`]
module to install the external dependency within the executor (the TFC node, in this case) at run time. In the future,
Gruntwork may offer modules through  a private Terraform registry to remove the SSH key requirement, further simplifying
the process.

Once the workspace is set up, you can trigger runs through the UI or from the `terraform` CLI. To use the CLI, follow https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/run/cli.html[the CLI-driven Run Workflow] instructions.

==== Using TFC with Terragrunt


The TFC UI runs only Terraform commands. Terragrunt expects you to run it, and it, in turn, will run Terraform.
Therefore, it currently is not possible to use the TFC UI to trigger Terragrunt. However, you can set up Terraform to run
remote operations such as plan and apply. That is, you use Terragrunt to organize your code and keep it DRY, and you can
configure it so that when you run `terragrunt apply` on your computer (or on a CI server), it runs `terraform apply` in
TFC rather than on your local system.

You'll still need workspaces, as described in the sections above on using TFC without Terragrunt. You can create the
workspace automatically or re-use a workspace that already exists, including variables and env vars already set in it,
such as your AWS access keys, so you don't need to have those locally. You'll also be able to see the apply output in
the web UI (but not trigger it from the web UI) and see the history of all apply calls in the web UI.

The steps involved to set all this up include:

* Obtain an API token to permit Terraform to use TFC
* Generate a `backend.tf` file to configure Terraform to point at TFC as a remote backend
* Set up workspaces for each module managed by Terragrunt
* Set input variables

Before digging in, we'll review an example Terragrunt configuration.

===== Setting up

For this example, we'll once again deploy an SQS queue from https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-messaging:[Gruntwork `package-messaging` repository].

Consider the following directory structure for an `infrastructure-live` repository:

[source]
----
.
├── dev
│   ├── account.hcl
│   └── us-east-1
│       ├── region.hcl
│       └── sqs
│           └── terragrunt.hcl
├── common.hcl
└── terragrunt.hcl
----

For simplicity, the example shows a single environment, `dev`, the `sqs` module, but this pattern could be expanded to more environments and regions as needed.

===== Obtain an API token

Terraform needs an API token to communicate with TFC as a backend. To obtain a token, open the user settings, and click
on _Tokens_. If you're running Terragrunt on a CI system, this token should be associated with a machine user rather
than an individual user account.

.Creating a TFC API token
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-as-code-library/tfc-token.png[]
{empty} +

Now you'll add the token to your https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/cli-config.html[`~/.terraformrc` file] in a `credentials` block.

[source,hcl]
----
# For TFE, substitute the custom hostname for your TFE host
credentials "app.terraform.io" {
  token = "xxxxxxyyyyyyyyyzzzzzzzzzzzz"
}
----

===== Generating the backend

For Terragrunt to use TFC as a remote executor, you'll need a `backend` block. The backend is what determines where
Terraform reads state and how execution is handled. The Terragrunt
https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#generate:[`generate` block] can generate
the backend block dynamically so you don't need to include one in each module.

Terraform https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/workspaces.html[workspaces] store the state associated with a given
backend. In the Terragrunt configuration hierarchy defined above, each module (just `sqs` in this case) uses a separate workspace and must have its own name in the `backend` block. Therefore, we'll need to gather all the component parts of our chosen workspace naming convention to use when setting up the backend.

Following https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/workspaces/naming.html[the advice from HashiCorp], we'll need:

* The name of the component, such as _sqs_
* The name of the environment, such as _dev_
* The region, such as _us-east-1_

The snippet below shows one technique for gathering the requisite information and generating the backend:


.infrastructure-live/terragrunt.hcl
[source,hcl]
----
locals {
  tfc_hostname     = "app.terraform.io" # For TFE, substitute the custom hostname for your TFE host
  tfc_organization = "gruntwork-io"
  workspace        = reverse(split("/", get_terragrunt_dir()))[0] # This will find the name of the module, such as "sqs"
  account_vars     = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("account.hcl"))
  region_vars     = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("region.hcl"))
}

generate "remote_state" {
  path      = "backend.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents = <<EOF
terraform {
  backend "remote" {
    hostname = "${local.tfc_hostname}"
    organization = "${local.tfc_organization}"
    workspaces {
      name = "${local.workspace}-${local.account_vars.locals.account}-${local.region_vars.locals.region}"
    }
  }
}
EOF
}
----

This code shows off a few features of Terragrunt:

* The `generate` block creates a file called `backend.tf` that will be created alongside the other `*.tf` files for the module that Terragrunt is operating on. This effectively adds a dynamically generated `backend` configuration to the module.
* Terragrunt has a set of https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/[built-in functions], like `find_in_parent_folders()`, `read_terragrunt_config()`, and `get_terragrunt_dir()`. These functions are used to obtain values need to configure the backend.
* Terragrunt can also use all of the https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions.html[native Terraform functions]. In the configuration above, we're using https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/split.html[`split()`] and https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/reverse.html[`reverse()`] to obtain the leaf directory name (such as `sqs`) that is used as the workspace suffix.

This configuration is at the root of the Terragrunt configuration tree so that it can be reused across each module, reducing code duplication. Note the use of `get_terragrunt_dir()` to obtain the workspace name. This function retrieves the current Terragrunt directory. If you run `terragrunt apply` from the `sqs` module, the value returned by `get_terragrunt_dir()` will be the fully qualified filesystem path to the sqs subdirectory. Although the function is in the root `terragrunt.hcl`, it runs in the context of the directory where `terragrunt` is invoked.

===== Creating a workspace and setting provider credentials

By default, if you configure the remote backend for a workspace that doesn't yet exist, TFC will automatically create one when you run `terraform init`. This is known as https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/run/cli.html#implicit-workspace-creation[implicit workspace creation]. Once the workspace exists, your Terraform code will need API credentials to interface with the cloud provider.

There are a few ways to set these credentials:

. Create all the workspaces manually in advance, and set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in each workspace, as described in  <<configure_credentials_and_variables>>.
. Create all the workspaces manually by running `terragrunt init`, and still set up the environment variables as previously mentioned.
. To set this up programmatically, you can use the https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/tfe/r/workspace.html[`tfe_workspace`] and https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/tfe/r/variable.html[`tfe_variable`] resources to configure the workspaces with Terraform.

In all cases, you'll need to ensure that your workspaces stay in sync with your Terragrunt configuration. Each time you add a new module in Terragrunt, you'll need a corresponding workspace. Furthermore, if you rotate your AWS API keys, you'll need to update them within each workspace. For that reason, the final option above is recommended.

===== Setting variables

In typical Terragrunt usage, variables are passed to Terraform using the https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#inputs[`inputs`] attribute. Anything defined in the inputs will be passed to Terraform using https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#environment-variables:[the environment variable mechanism]. However, this mechanism is not supported by TFC. Instead, you can generate a `*.auto.tfvars` file containing the inputs.

[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: The generated `terragrunt.auto.tfvars` file will be present on local disk. Depending upon your configuration, this file may contain sensitive data. Do not commit this file to version control. We recommend adding the `*.auto.tfvars` to `.gitignore`.

The following code shows how to generate a `terragrunt.auto.tfvars` file.

.infrastructure-live/dev/us-east-1/sqs/terragrunt.hcl
[source,hcl]
----
terraform {
  source = "git::ssh://git@github.com/gruntwork-io/package-messaging//modules/sqs?ref=v0.3.2"
}

include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

locals {
  common_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("common.hcl"))
}

generate "tfvars" {
  path      = "terragrunt.auto.tfvars"
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  disable_signature = true
  contents = <<-EOF
name = "${local.common_vars.locals.name}"
EOF
}
----

The configuration has a few sections:

. The `terraform` block at the top uses the Gruntwork `sqs` module from https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-messaging/[`package-messaging`].
. The `include` block includes the configuration from the parent directories. This is how the remote `backend` block from the root `terragrunt.hcl` is included.
. The `locals` block reads the values from `common.hcl` in the root of the hierarchy, making them available for local reference.
. Finally, the `generate` block creates a file called `terragrunt.auto.tfvars`. Like the `backend.tf` file, this file will be generated alongside the rest of the `*.tf` files that Terragrunt downloads from the `sqs` module, making those inputs available for TFC to read when running `terraform` commands in the remote executor.

Any of the inputs needed by the module must be included in the generated tfvars file. In the configuration above, only
the `name` variable is specified. Most modules will need more configuration.

===== Running Terragrunt

With all the pieces in place, you can run `terragrunt init` to initialize the workspace, if it isn't already there, and then `terragrunt apply`, and watch as Terragrunt invokes Terraform, which executes the `plan` and `apply` stages on TFC, pausing in between to allow confirmation. Note that when running a `terragrunt apply-all`, Terragrunt adds the `-auto-approve` flag to Terraform to skip interactive approval. This means that with `apply-all`, there will be no confirmation step.

First, we run `terragrunt init`. Terragrunt generates the backend configuration, the tfvars file, and connects to the remote. Irrelevant details have been omitted from the output.

TFC runs a plan first, waits for confirmation, and then runs apply. The confirmation can be entered either on the command line or in the UI. Once complete, the results are visible in the TFC UI:

Other commands, such as `destroy`, work in the same way.

===== Summarizing Terragrunt and TFC/TFE compatibility

Using the combination of features above, you can effectively use Terragrunt with TFC or TFE as a remote backend.
Terragrunt can generate backend blocks and tfvars files. Commands like `terragrunt apply-all` will operate in the same
way as they do without TFC/TFE, calling each module dependency in order, and allowing for passing outputs between
modules. Workspaces must be created in advance so that you can set up credentials for access to the cloud.

Happy Terragrunting!

[[using_scripts_binaries]]
=== Using scripts and binaries

This section will show you how to use scripts and binaries from the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library. As illustrative examples,
we'll deploy the `ip-lockdown` script and `ssh-grunt` binary from
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security[module-security].

[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: You must be a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscriber# to access `module-security`.

ip-lockdown::
  `ip-lockdown` is a Bash script you can use to lock down specific outgoing IP addresses on a Linux server so only
  whitelisted OS users can access them. The main motivation is to lock down the
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html[metadata endpoint] on EC2 instances so
  only specific users (e.g., root) can access it—and thereby access the attached IAM permissions—rather than just any
  user who happens to get access to the EC2 instance.

ssh-grunt::
  `ssh-grunt` is a binary (compiled from Go code) that allows you to manage SSH access to your EC2 instances using an
  identity provider such as AWS IAM or any SAML-based identity provider (e.g., Active Directory, Google, Okta, etc.).
  This allows you to grant access to specific EC2 instances by putting developers into certain groups (e.g., into
  specific IAM groups or AD groups) and for each developer to SSH to EC2 instances using their own username and SSH
  key.

Let's walk through how to use these two tools.

==== Gruntwork Installer

The easiest way to install scripts and binaries from the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library is to use the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer[Gruntwork Installer]. This is an open source Bash script that
allows you to install scripts and binaries via a one-liner, similar to `apt-get install` or `yum install` (if you're
curious why we don't use `apt` or `yum` directly, see
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer#motivation[Gruntwork Installer Motivation]).

The first step is to install the Gruntwork Installer itself, which you can do as follows (make sure to replace
`<VERSION>` below with the latest version from the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer/releases[Gruntwork Installer releases page]):

[source,bash]
----
curl -LsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer/master/bootstrap-gruntwork-installer.sh | bash /dev/stdin --version <VERSION>
----

Now you can install any script `XXX` at version `YYY` from repo `ZZZ` of the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library as follows:

[source,bash]
----
gruntwork install --module-name XXX --tag YYY --repo ZZZ
----

And you can install any binary `XXX` at version `YYY` from repo `ZZZ` of the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library as follows:

[source,bash]
----
gruntwork install --binary-name XXX --tag YYY --repo ZZZ
----

Note that if repo `ZZZ` is a private GitHub repo (which `module-security` is), you'll need to authenticate by setting
your https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line[GitHub personal access token]
as the environment variable `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN`:

[source,bash]
----
export GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN=(YOUR_TOKEN)
----

Once you've set this token, to install the `ip-lockdown` script and `ssh-grunt` binary, you run the following (make
sure to replace `<VERSION>` with the latest version from the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security/releases[module-security releases page]):

[source,bash]
----
gruntwork install \
  --module-name ip-lockdown \
  --tag <VERSION> \
  --repo https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security

gruntwork install \
  --binary-name ssh-grunt \
  --tag <VERSION> \
  --repo https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security
----

Now that you know _how_ to use Gruntwork Installer, let's talk about _where_ to use it. Your goal is to install the
scripts and binaries onto your servers (e.g., EC2 instances, compute instances). To do this, we recommend following
<<immutable_infrastructure>> practices, and creating versioned, immutable images using Packer and/or Docker, as
described in the next two sections.

==== Building images with Packer

If you want to build machine images with scripts and binaries from the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library, such as an Amazon
Machine Image (AMI) for use in AWS, you can use https://www.packer.io[Packer].

===== Packer basics

Here's an example of how to use `gruntwork-install` in a Packer template:

.packer-example.json
[source,json]
----
{
  "variables": {
    "github_auth_token": "{{env `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN`}}"
  },
  "builders": [{
    "type": "amazon-ebs",
    "ami_name": "packer-example-{{timestamp}}",
    "region": "us-east-2",
    "source_ami_filter": {
      "filters": {
        "virtualization-type": "hvm",
        "architecture": "x86_64",
        "name": "ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-bionic-18.04-amd64-server-*",
        "block-device-mapping.volume-type": "gp2",
        "root-device-type": "ebs"
      },
      "owners": [
        "099720109477"
      ],
      "most_recent": true
    },
    "instance_type": "t2.micro",
    "ssh_username": "ubuntu"
  }],
  "provisioners": [{
    "type": "shell",
    "inline": [
      "curl -LsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer/master/bootstrap-gruntwork-installer.sh | bash /dev/stdin --version v0.0.22",
      "gruntwork install --module-name ip-lockdown --tag v0.18.4 --repo https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security",
      "gruntwork install --binary-name ssh-grunt --tag v0.18.4 --repo https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security"
    ],
    "environment_vars": [
      "GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN={{user `github_auth_token`}}"
    ]
  }]
}
----

A few things to notice about this Packer template:

* The `type` of the builder is `amazon-ebs`, so this Packer template can be used to build an AMI.
* The `source_ami_filter` is configured to find the latest Ubuntu 18.04 AMI to use as the base for this image.
* The GitHub personal access token is read from the environment variable `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN` (it is NOT hard-coded
  into the Packer template itself, as you should never store secrets in plain text) and passed to the `shell`
  provisioner.
* The `shell` provisioner installs the Gruntwork Installer and then uses it to install `ip-lockdown` and `ssh-grunt`
  at specific versions.

[[manual_testing_packer]]
===== Manually testing a Packer template

To build a machine image from a Packer template, you authenticate to a sandbox environment for testing and run:

[source,bash]
----
export GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN=(YOUR_TOKEN)
packer build packer-example.json
----

At the end of the build, Packer will output the ID of your new image (e.g., the new AMI ID). You can then test the
image works as you expect by deploying it into a sandbox environment. You can deploy manually or via an automated
process, as described in <<deploy_packer>>.

[[automated_testing_packer]]
===== Automated tests for a Packer template

Just as with <<automated_tests_terraform>>, you can use https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/[Terratest] to create
automated tests for your Packer template. These are typically integration tests that:

. Build an artifact using Packer.
. Deploy the artifact on top of real infrastructure (e.g., deploy the artifact onto real EC2 instances in AWS or
  compute instances in GCP). Often, this is done by using Terraform code, passing in the artifact ID as an input
  variable.
. Validate infrastructure works as expected.
. Undeploy the infrastructure.
. Delete the artifact.

Take a look at
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/blob/master/test/terraform_packer_example_test.go[terraform_packer_example_test.go]
for an example of an automated test that implements this exact pattern. Check out the <<automated_tests_terraform>>
section for instructions on how to write and run tests written with Terratest.

===== Using Docker for faster testing

Building machine images in the cloud (i.e., in AWS and GCP) can take a while, as you have to fire up a virtual server,
run your provisioners, snapshot the server, shut it down, etc. This can add a few minutes of overhead to each
Packer build. One way to speed it up for local testing is to add a Docker builder to your Packer template that uses
the same base OS image. This will allow you to run the build completely locally _and_ run the resulting image
locally too (see <<manually_test_docker>>), both of which can dramatically improve iteration speed. Once the
Docker image is working fully, you can then build the machine image you want, with most of the errors in your template
already resolved.

See https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/#iterating-locally-using-docker[Iterating locally using Docker] for more
details.

[[deploy_packer]]
===== Deploying Packer images

Now that your Packer template has been thoroughly tested, you can deploy machine images to your real environments
(e.g., staging and production). There are many ways to deploy machine images. We recommend using Terraform modules,
as explained in <<using_terraform_modules>>. For example, you can use the following modules, which allow you to specify
the machine image (i.e., AMI) to deploy via an input variable (e.g., `ami_id`):

* *AWS Auto Scaling Group:* use the
  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-asg/tree/master/modules/asg-rolling-deploy[asg-rolling-deploy module] for
  stateless apps that need auto scaling, auto healing, and zero-downtime rolling deployment; use the
  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-asg/tree/master/modules/server-group[server-group module] for stateful apps
  that need auto healing, zero-downtime rolling deployment, and persistent EBS volumes and ENIs. Both of these modules
  are part of `module-asg`.
+
[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: You must be a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscriber# to access `module-asg`.
* *Single EC2 Instance:* use the
  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-server/tree/master/modules/single-server[single-server module] to run a single
  EC2 instance that can attach persistent EBS volumes and ENIs. This module is part of `module-server`.
+
[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: You must be a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscriber# to access `module-server`.
+
Note that a single server is a single point of failure, so we generally recommend using one of the Auto Scaling Group
modules instead, even just for one server, so you get auto healing and zero-downtime deployment.

===== Updating Packer templates

Now that you have your Packer images deployed, you can pull in updates as follows:

. Subscribe to the monthly https://blog.gruntwork.io/tagged/gruntwork-newsletter[Gruntwork Newsletter] to be notified
  of all updates to the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library. Alternatively, you can "watch" repos in GitHub that you're
  interested in.
. When you find an update you'd like for a specific module, update any code using that module in your Packer templates
  to the new version number. For example, if you were using `module-security` at `v0.18.3` and you
  wanted to update to `v0.18.4`, you would change from:
+
[source,json]
----
"gruntwork install --module-name ip-lockdown --tag v0.18.3 --repo https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security"
----
+
to:
+
[source,json]
----
"gruntwork install --module-name ip-lockdown --tag v0.18.4 --repo https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security"
----
. Pay close attention to the release notes for any additional instructions. In particular, if the MINOR version number
  was increased (e.g., `v0.17.0` -> `v0.18.0`), that implies a backwards incompatible change, and the release notes will
  explain what you need to do (e.g., you might have to add, remove, or change arguments you pass to the module).
. Tests your changes locally. You do this using the same process outlined in <<manual_testing_packer>> and
  <<automated_testing_packer>>.
. Deploy your changes to each environment. You do this using the same process outlined in <<deploy_packer>>.

[[building_images_docker]]
==== Building images with Docker

If you want to build Docker images with scripts and binaries from the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library, you can create a
`Dockerfile`.

===== Dockerfile basics

Here's an example of how to use `gruntwork-install` in a `Dockerfile`:

.Dockerfile
[source,Dockerfile]
----
# This is an intermediate stage. We can safely pass secrets into it, as this stage will be thrown away.
FROM ubuntu:18.04 as intermediate

# You must set a GitHub personal access token as a build arg. This will be used to access the private gruntwork-io
# GitHub repos
ARG GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN
RUN if [ -z "$GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN" ]; then echo "ERROR: You must set GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN as a Docker build arg."; exit 1; fi

RUN curl -LsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer/master/bootstrap-gruntwork-installer.sh | bash /dev/stdin --version v0.0.22 && \
    gruntwork install --module-name ip-lockdown --tag v0.18.4 --repo https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security && \
    gruntwork install --binary-name ssh-grunt --tag v0.18.4 --repo https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security

# This is the real Docker image that will be created in the end. It just carefully copies code from the intermediate.
# Note that the secrets from the intermediate will NOT be copied and published.
FROM ubuntu:18.04

# Copy just what we need from the intermediate image
COPY --from=intermediate /usr/local/bin/ip-lockdown /usr/local/bin/ip-lockdown
COPY --from=intermediate /usr/local/bin/ssh-grunt /usr/local/bin/ssh-grunt
----

A few things to notice about this Packer template:

* We are using a https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/[multi-stage build]. This ensures that
  the GitHub personal access token, which is passed in as a build argument, does not get stored in the final Docker
  image.
* The GitHub personal access token is passed in as a Docker build arg to the first stage. This stage is therefore able
  to run `gruntwork-install` against private repos.
* The second stage copies just the installed scripts/binaries from the first stage. Note that none of the build
  arguments get copied, so they will NOT end up in the final Docker image.

[[manually_build_docker]]
===== Building a Docker image

To build a Docker image from a `Dockerfile`, you run:

[source,bash]
----
docker build --build-arg GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN> -t <IMAGE_NAME>:<IMAGE_TAG> .
----

where:

YOUR_TOKEN::
  Your GitHub personal access token.

IMAGE_NAME::
  The name to use for the image. When using Docker Hub as a Docker Registry (more on registries below), this is
  typically of the format `<ORG>/<NAME>`, where `ORG` is your organization name and `NAME` is the name for this
  image (e.g., `gruntwork-io/example-image`). When using ECR as a Docker Registry, this will be a URL of the form
  `<ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/<NAME>`, where `ACCOUNT_ID` is your AWS account ID, `REGION` is the
  AWS region where the ECR repo lives, and `NAME` is the name for this image
  (e.g., `111122223333.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/example-image`).

IMAGE_TAG::
  An optional tag to add to the image. This is often used for version numbers (e.g., `v1`).

[[manually_test_docker]]
===== Manually testing a Docker image

To manually test a Docker image, you run:

[source,bash]
----
docker run <IMAGE_NAME>:<IMAGE_TAG>
----

Where `IMAGE_NAME` and `IMAGE_TAG` are the name and tag for the Docker image you built earlier, as defined in
<<manually_build_docker>>. This will run the default command (`CMD`) defined in the `Dockerfile`. Sometimes, you may
want to override this command. For example, to fire up a Bash prompt in your Docker image, you can typically run the
following:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it <IMAGE_NAME>:<IMAGE_TAG> bash
----

Note the `-it` flags to enable an interactive TTY so you can enter commands at the bash prompt.

If your Docker image needs to listen on a port, you can map this port to a port number on your host OS using the `-p`
flag:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -p 80:8080 <IMAGE_NAME>:<IMAGE_TAG>

# In another terminal
curl localhost:8080
----

If you find yourself running a lot of Docker commands, and having to remember lots of command-line arguments and
environment variables to set for each one, look into using https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose], which
allows you to define one or more Docker containers to run and all the parameters for each one in a YAML file, and then
run everything with a single `docker-compose up`.

[[automated_test_docker]]
===== Automated tests for Docker images

Just as with <<automated_tests_terraform>>, you can use https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/[Terratest] to create
automated tests for your Docker images. These are typically integration tests that:

. Build a Docker image.
. Deploy the Docker image, either by running `docker run`, `docker-compose up`, or deploying it via a Docker
  orchestration tool such as Kubernetes (more on this in <<deploying_docker_images>>).
. Validate the Docker image works as expected.
. Undeploy the Docker image.

Take a look at
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/blob/master/test/kubernetes_basic_example_service_check_test.go[kubernetes_basic_example_service_check_test.go]
for an example of an automated test that implements this exact pattern. Check out the <<automated_tests_terraform>>
section for instructions on how to write and run tests written with Terratest.

===== Publishing Docker images to a registry

To be able to use your Docker images beyond a single computer, you can publish them to a Docker Registry. The most
popular options are:

* https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/[Amazon ECR]: Recommended for AWS users.
* https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/[Container Registry]: Recommended for GCP users.
* https://hub.docker.com[Docker Hub]: Recommended for open source.

The general workflow is:

. Login to your Docker Registry: `docker login`. Check your Registry's documentation for authentication details.
. Build your Docker image: `docker build -t <IMAGE_NAME>:<IMAGE_TAG> .`
. Push your Docker image to the Registry: `docker push <IMAGE_NAME>:<IMAGE_TAG>`.

[[deploying_docker_images]]
===== Deploying Docker images

Now that your Docker image has been thoroughly tested and pushed to a Docker Registry, you can deploy it to your real
environments (e.g., staging and production). There are many ways to deploy Docker images, so in this guide, we'll
highlight just the following ones:

Kubernetes::
  To deploy your Docker image to Kubernetes, you'll first need to set up a Kubernetes cluster. For AWS, we recommend
  using https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks[terraform-aws-eks] to deploy an EKS cluster; for GCP, we
  recommend using https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-gke[terraform-google-gke] to deploy a GKE cluster.
+
[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: You must be a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscriber# to access `terraform-aws-eks`.
+
Once you have a working cluster, there are a number of ways to deploy Docker images. The basic version is to run
`kubectl apply` and pass it a YAML manifest. However, most teams find this too verbose and repetitive, so a more DRY
option is to use something like Helm. To run Helm, we recommend using
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-kubernetes-helm[terraform-kubernetes-helm] and
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services[helm-kubernetes-services].

ECS::
  To deploy your Docker image to ECS, you'll first need to set up an ECS cluster, which you can do using
  the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ecs/tree/master/modules/ecs-cluster[ecs-cluster] module in `module-ecs`.
+
[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: You must be a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscriber# to access `module-ecs`.
+
Once you have a working cluster, you can deploy your Docker image using one of the `ecs-service-xxx` modules in
`module-ecs`, such as `ecs-service-with-alb` or `ecs-daemon-service`.

Fargate::
  To deploy a Docker image using Fargate, you'll first need to set up a Fargate cluster. You can do this by directly
  using the https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/ecs_cluster.html[aws_ecs_cluster] Terraform resource, as
  Fargate will manage all the worker nodes for you. Once you've created the cluster, you can deploy your image using
  the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ecs/tree/master/modules/ecs-fargate[ecs-fargate] module in `module-ecs`.
+
[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: You must be a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscriber# to access `module-ecs`.

===== Updating Docker images

Now that you have your Docker images deployed, you can pull in updates as follows:

. Subscribe to the monthly https://blog.gruntwork.io/tagged/gruntwork-newsletter[Gruntwork Newsletter] to be notified
  of all updates to the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library. Alternatively, you can "watch" repos in GitHub that you're
  interested in.
. When you find an update you'd like for a specific module, update any code using that module in your `Dockerfiles`
  to the new version number. For example, if you were using `module-security` at `v0.18.3` and you
  wanted to update to `v0.18.4`, you would change from:
+
[source,Dockerfile]
----
RUN gruntwork install --module-name ip-lockdown --tag v0.18.3 --repo https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security
----
+
to:
+
[source,Dockerfile]
----
RUN gruntwork install --module-name ip-lockdown --tag v0.18.4 --repo https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security
----
. Pay close attention to the release notes for any additional instructions. In particular, if the MINOR version number
  was increased (e.g., `v0.17.0` -> `v0.18.0`), that implies a backwards incompatible change, and the release notes will
  explain what you need to do (e.g., you might have to add, remove, or change arguments you pass to the module).
. Tests your changes locally. You do this using the same process outlined in <<manually_test_docker>> and
  <<automated_test_docker>>.
. Deploy your changes to each environment. You do this using the same process outlined in <<deploying_docker_images>>.

==== Gruntwork Installer alternatives

The Gruntwork Installer may not be a good fit for all companies, either because it's a Bash script, so it won't work on
Windows, or perhaps due to security concerns (see
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer#security[Gruntwork Installer Security]). If that's the case, your
best alternative is to copy the script (from the `modules` folder of the repo) or binary (from the releases page of
the repo) you're interested in directly to your own repositories, so it's a local file for your builds. This will allow
you to use, for example, the `file` provisioner in Packer to copy it into your machine images, or the `COPY` command in
Docker to copy it into your Docker images.

Note that the major drawback of copying these files is that you'll have to manually pull in new versions any time the
Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library is updated.

==== Packer and Docker alternatives

Although this guide outlines how to use Docker and Packer, you can also use the scripts and binaries in the Gruntwork
Infrastructure as Code Library and the Gruntwork Installer with any other configuration management strategy, such as Chef, Ansible,
Puppet, or Salt. Check the docs for your chosen configuration management tool on how to copy and execute scripts and
binaries.


[[using_helm_charts]]
=== Using Helm Charts

This section will show you how to use Helm charts from the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library. As an illustrative
example, we'll deploy the official Nginx docker container using the `k8s-service` helm chart from
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services[helm-kubernetes-services].

You can use this Helm chart to deploy any web or worker service Docker container onto Kubernetes.

==== Add Gruntwork Helm chart repository

The Helm charts in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library are distributed using a Helm Chart Repository. In order
to access Helm charts that are a part of the Gruntwork Helm chart repository, you will need to add the repository for
use with your client:

[source,bash]
----
helm repo add gruntwork https://helmcharts.gruntwork.io
----

Once the repository is added, you can install any chart that is a part of the repository by accessing them under the
namespace `gruntwork`. To find the available charts distributed by a particular repository, you can use the `search`
command from the helm client:

[source,bash]
----
helm search gruntwork
----

This will query the Gruntwork Helm chart repository for information on all the available charts distributed by the
repository, showing you a list similar to below:

[source,bash]
----
NAME                    CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION
gruntwork/k8s-service   v0.0.10                         A Helm chart to package your application container for Ku...
----

==== Deploying a chart

Unlike most charts in the community, Helm charts that are a part of the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library have a
set of required input values. Therefore, you can not run `helm install CHART_NAME` to install a chart on to your
Kubernetes cluster.

Each of the charts document the required and optional input values in the corresponding `values.yaml` file for the
chart. You can access the `values.yaml` of a chart either by inspecting the source code for the chart, or using the `helm
inspect` command. For example, to see the values of the `k8s-service` chart, you can run:

[source,bash]
----
helm inspect values gruntwork/k8s-service
----

You can use this as a starting point to construct your own `values.yaml` file:

[source,bash]
----
helm inspect values gruntwork/k8s-service > values.yaml
----

You can then open up this `values.yaml` file and fill in the required and optional parameters. For `k8s-service`, the two required
parameters are `containerImage` and `applicationName`. For this example, we can fill in the official Nginx container
from Docker Hub for the `containerImage` and `nginx` for the `applicationName`:

.values.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CHART PARAMETERS
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# REQUIRED VALUES
# These values are expected to be defined and passed in by the operator when deploying this helm chart.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# containerImage is a map that describes the container image that should be used to serve the application managed by
# this chart.
containerImage:
  repository: nginx
  tag: 1.16.1

# applicationName is a string that names the application. This is used to label the pod and to name the main application
# container in the pod spec. The label is keyed under "gruntwork.io/app-name"
applicationName: "nginx"
----

Note that you are free to override any default parameters in the `values.yaml` file. When you install the chart, this
`values.yaml` file is merged with the default `values.yaml` file distributed with the chart, allowing you to override
those parameters.

Once you have a `values.yaml` that specifies all the inputs, you can install the chart using those as inputs:

[source,bash]
----
helm install -n nginx -f values.yaml gruntwork/k8s-service
----

This will render the yaml files in the chart using the input values as parameters and apply it onto the Kubernetes
cluster.

[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: In the previous example, we passed in the parameter `-n nginx` to the `install` command. This allows us to
force a release name for the deployment. When you install a chart using Helm, Helm tracks that deployment as a
_release_ and binds all the related resources under a unique name. If you don't provide a release name, Helm will
automatically generate a random name that is not related to the charts (e.g `witty-lobster`). This makes maintenance
difficult as you will need to refer to this release name any time you want to make changes to the deployment.


==== Updating a previous deployment

Once a chart is installed and deployed, you can use the `update` command to make changes to it. For example, if you
wanted to deploy an updated version of Nginx using our example, you can update the `values.yaml` file to point to a
later version, and then run `helm update` with the updated input values and release name:

[source,bash]
----
helm upgrade -f values.yaml nginx gruntwork/k8s-service
----

This command will render the `gruntwork/k8s-service` chart using the updated input values, and then replace the
resources under the Helm release `nginx`.

You can also use the `upgrade` command to update to a later version of the chart:

[source,bash]
----
helm upgrade -f values.yaml --version v0.0.10 nginx gruntwork/k8s-service
----

The above command will use version `v0.0.10` of the `gruntwork/k8s-service` chart when rendering the values.


=== Contributing to the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library

Contributions to the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library are very welcome and appreciated! If you find a bug or want to add a new
feature or even contribute an entirely new module, we are very happy to accept
https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/[pull requests], provide feedback, and run your changes through
our automated test suite.

This section outlines the process for contributing.

==== File a GitHub issue

Before starting any work, we recommend filing a GitHub issue in the appropriate repo. This is your chance to ask
questions and get feedback from the maintainers and the community before you sink a lot of time into writing (possibly
the wrong) code. If there is anything you're unsure about, just ask!

==== Update the documentation

We recommend updating the documentation _before_ updating any code (see
http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html[Readme Driven Development]). This ensures the
documentation stays up to date and allows you to think through the problem at a high level before you get lost in the
weeds of coding.

==== Update the tests

We also recommend updating the automated tests _before_ updating any code (see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development[Test Driven Development]). That means you add or update a test
case, verify that it's failing with a clear error message, and then make the code changes to get that test to pass.
This ensures the tests stay up to date and verify all the functionality in the repo, including whatever new
functionality you're adding in your contribution. The `test` folder in every repo will have documentation on how to run
the tests locally.

==== Update the code

At this point, make your code changes and use your new test case to verify that everything is working.

==== Create a pull request

https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/[Create a pull request] with your changes. Please make sure
to include the following:

. A description of the change, including a link to your GitHub issue.
. Any notes on backwards incompatibility.

==== Merge and release

The maintainers for the repo will review your code and provide feedback. If everything looks good, they will merge the
code and release a new version.

=== Forking the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library

The https://gruntwork.io/terms/[Gruntwork Terms of Service] give you permissions to fork the code from the Gruntwork
Infrastructure as Code Library into your own repos. This is useful if your company does not allow external dependencies (e.g., you
have a company policy that requires all source code to be pulled from an internal GitHub Enterprise or BitBucket
server) or if you need to make modifications to the Infrastructure as Code Library that you do not wish to contribute back to
Gruntwork. This section will walk you through what you need to do to fork the code.

[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: The definition of an _Authorized User_ from the Gruntwork Terms of Service does NOT change if you fork the
code. That is, if you create internal forks and give 50 users access to those internal forks, then the Gruntwork
License requires that you pay for 50 Authorized Users.

==== How to fork the code

Here is how you fork the code in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library:

. Copy each Gruntwork repo into your private repositories.
. You'll also want to copy all the versioned releases (see the `/releases` page for each repo).
. For repos that contain pre-built binaries (such as `ssh-grunt` mentioned earlier), you'll want to copy those binaries
  as well.
. Within each repo, search for any cross-references to other Gruntwork repos. Most of the repos are standalone, but
  some of the Terraform and Go code is shared across repos (e.g., the `package-kafka` and `package-zookeeper` repos
  use the `module-asg` repo under the hood to run an Auto Scaling Group). You'll need to update Terraform source URLs
  and Go import statements from `github.com/gruntwork-io` to your private Git repo URLs.

You'll want to automate the entire process above and run it on a regular schedule (e.g., daily). The Gruntwork
Infrastructure as Code Library is updated continuously, both by the Gruntwork team and contributions from our community
of customers (see the monthly https://blog.gruntwork.io/tagged/gruntwork-newsletter[Gruntwork Newsletter] for details),
so you'll want to pull in these updates as quickly as you can.

==== How to use your forked code

Once you've forked the code, using it in is very similar to what is outlined in <<using_terraform_modules>> and
<<using_scripts_binaries>>, except for the following differences:

. Point the `source` URLs of your Terraform modules to your own Git repos, rather than the `gruntwork-io` GitHub org.
. Point the `--repo` parameter of `gruntwork-install` to your own Git repos, rather than the `gruntwork-io` GitHub org.

==== Drawbacks to forking

While forking is allowed under the Gruntwork Terms of Services, it has some downsides:

* You have to do a lot of work up-front to copy the repos, releases, and pre-compiled binaries and update internal
  links.
* You have to do more work to run this process on a regular basis and deal with merge conflicts.
* If your team isn't directly using the Gruntwork GitHub repos on a regular basis, then you're less likely to
  participate in issues and pull requests, and you won't be benefiting as much from the Gruntwork community.

So, whenever possible, use the code directly from the `gruntwork-io` GitHub org, as documented in
<<using_terraform_modules>> and <<using_scripts_binaries>>. If your team relies on NPM, Docker Hub, Maven Central,
GitHub, or the Terraform Registry, using Gruntwork repos directly is no different. However, if your company completely
bans all outside sources, then follow the instructions above to fork the code, and good luck!

=== Operating system compatibility

Here's a summary of the operating systems supported by Gruntwork the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library as of August, 2019:

Terraform modules::
  Just about all the Terraform modules in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library work on all major operating systems. However,
  there are a handful of modules where we have to call out to scripts from our Terraform code. Most of these
  scripts are Python and work on all major operating systems (as long as Python is installed), but there are a couple
  places where we call Bash code (mostly `sleep 30` to work around Terraform bugs). If you run into a portability
  issue, please report it as a bug, and we'll get it fixed!

Go binaries::
  The Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library includes a number of dev tools written in Go which are compiled into standalone
  binaries for every major operating system. This applies to tools such as `Terragrunt`, `cloud-nuke`,
  `openvpn-admin`, `houston`, `gruntkms`, `ssh-grunt`, `gruntsam`, and `kubergrunt`.

Linux server scripts::
  There are a number of scripts in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library that are meant to be installed and executed on Linux
  servers in AWS and GCP. These include `install-xxx` and `run-xxx` scripts (e.g., `install-vault`, `run-vault`,
  `install-kafka`, `run-kafka`, `install-elasticsearch`, `run-elasticsearch`, etc.), CI / CD scripts (e.g.,
  `aws-helpers`, `build-helpers`, `circleci-helpers`, `git-helpers`, `terraform-helpers`), and server scripts (e.g.,
  `attach-eni`, `mount-ebs-volume`, `add-dns-a-record`). See <<using_scripts_binaries>> for how these scripts are meant
  to be installed and used.

Deployment scripts::
  There are a handful of deployment scripts in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library that are meant to be executed by a
  developer directly, such as the `roll-out-ecs-cluster-update.py` script used to do zero-downtime rolling deployments
  for ECS clusters. These scripts are written in Python and should work on all major operating systems.

Need Windows support?::
  While Windows users can use most of the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library, the vast majority of Gruntwork customers use
  Linux or Mac, so we haven't prioritized improving our Windows support. If you would like us to improve our Windows
  support, please https://gruntwork.io/contact/[contact us].

== Next steps

Now that you've learned how to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library, you can start leveraging it to build your
infrastructure! Here are some good first steps:

. link:/guides/kubernetes/how-to-deploy-production-grade-kubernetes-cluster-aws[How to deploy a production grade Kubernetes (EKS) cluster in AWS]

TODO: move this to the "using the module" section
This configures Terraform as follows:

Configure a backend::
  The code above configures a _backend_, which is a shared location where Terraform state can be stored and accessed by
  your team. You can use any of the https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/index.html[supported backends] (the
  example above uses S3, which is a good choice for AWS users). See
  https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-manage-terraform-state-28f5697e68fa[How to manage Terraform state] for more info.

Partial configuration::
  The backend uses a _https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/config.html#partial-configuration[partial configuration]_,
  which means most of the backend configuration (e.g., which S3 bucket and path to use) will be specified from outside
  of the code. You'll see an example of this soon.
