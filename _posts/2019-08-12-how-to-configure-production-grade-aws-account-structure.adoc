== Intro

This guide will walk you through the process of configuring a production-grade AWS account structure, including how to manage multiple environments, users, permissions, and audit logging. We'll also discuss how to implement a _Landing Zone_ solution that lets you quickly spin up new AWS accounts that all implement a _security baseline_ that enforces your company's policies.

=== What is an AWS account structure?

To use AWS, you sign up for an AWS account. An _AWS account structure_ is an organized collection of inter-connected
AWS accounts designed to run production workloads.

Configuring an AWS account structure serves three primary purposes:

Isolation (AKA compartmentalization)::
  You use separate AWS accounts to isolate different environments from each other and to limit the "blast radius" when
  things go wrong. For example, putting your staging and production environments in separate AWS accounts ensures that
  if an attacker manages to break into staging, they still have no access whatsoever to production. Likewise, this
  isolation ensures a developer making changes in staging is less likely to accidentally break something in production.

Authentication and authorization::
  If you configure your AWS account structure correctly, you'll be able to manage all user accounts in one place, making
  it easier to enforce password policies, multi-factor authentication, key rotation, and other security requirements.
  Using multiple AWS accounts also makes it easier to have fine-grained control over what permissions each developer
  gets in each environment.

Auditing and reporting::
  A properly configured AWS account structure will allow you to maintain an audit trail of all the changes happening in
  all your environments, check if you're adhering to compliance requirements, and detect anomalies. Moreover, you'll be
  able to have consolidated billing, with all the charges for all of your AWS accounts in one place, including cost
  breakdowns by account, service, tag, etc.

=== What you'll learn in this guide

This guide consists of four main sections:

=== Gruntwork AWS Landing Zone vs the alternatives

In June 2018, Amazon https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/06/introducing-aws-landing-zone/[announced]
AWS Landing Zone, which solved three core problems:

1. Streamline the process of creating a new AWS account;
2. Configure that new AWS account according to best practices;
3. And make it possible to configure a best-practices multi-AWS-account setup.

Almost every AWS customer that creates more than a few accounts needs to solve these problems, so over time we
saw additional solutions enter the market. We call all of these options "Landing Zone solutions" and when we
evaluated them, we found that they varied along the following dimensions:

* **Customizability.** Some users are content to stick with AWS's default definition of "best
practices" for how their newly created account should be configured, but other customers would like to add to,
subtract from or modify that definition and some Landing Zones offer very little customization at all.

* **Automatable.** Many users want to define their own custom pipeline for creating new AWS accounts, but not all
Landing Zone solutions can be integrated into an arbitrary pipeline. For example, AWS Control Tower includes
Landing Zone functionality, but does not expose any kind of API and is usable only from the management console.

* **UI-driven.** Some AWS users want a first-class UI they can use to deploy new AWS accounts, but not all Landing
Zone solutions expose a UI.

* **Terraform-native.** Terraform users often want 100% of their deployed infrastructure to be codified in Terraform,
but some Landing Zone solutions only offer support for CloudFormation or no infrastructure as code at all.

* **No dependencies.** Some AWS Landing Zone solutions depend on purchasing related commercial products or services
to have access to them or to make them work, whereas other Landing Zone solutions stand on their own without any
third-party or related-service dependencies.

With these dimensions in mind, we set out to build a Landing Zone solution that:

* Is fully customizable
* Is easily automatable as part of a separate pipeline
* Is 100% Terraform-native
* Does not depend on any third-party products or related services

Because we use Terraform, we do not currently see the need for adding a first-class UI to our Landing Zone
solution, however some users may wish to add UI or UI-like functionality through their CI system or other Terraform
automation tools.

=== AWS account

To use AWS, you must create an AWS account. You do this by signing up at https://aws.amazon.com. Once you've created
an account, it will get a unique, 12-digit
_https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html[AWS account ID]_ (note: the account ID is
not in and of itself a secret, so it's OK to share it with trusted 3rd parties, but you might not want to go so far as
to share it publicly on the Internet), and you will be logged into your new AWS account as the root user.

=== Root user

Each AWS account has exactly one _root user_:

User name::
  The email address you provide when creating a new AWS account becomes the user name of your root user. This email
  address must be unique across ALL AWS accounts globally, so you can't use the same email address to create multiple
  AWS accounts.

Console password::
  When creating a new AWS account, you will create a _console password_ that, along with the root user's user name,
  you can use to login to the AWS console.

Logging into the AWS console::
  After the initial sign up, if you wish to login as the root user, you have to go to
  https://console.aws.amazon.com and login using the root user's email address and password.

Access keys::
  The root user can optionally have a set of
  _https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys[access keys]_,
  which are the credentials you use to login to your AWS account programmatically (e.g., on the command line or when
  making API calls). Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID (for example, `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`) and a
  secret access key (for example, `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`).

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)::
  You can enable
  _https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html[Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)]_ for the
  root user (*strongly recommended*), which will require you to provide not only the user name and password when
  logging in, but also a temporary, one-time token generated by either a virtual or physical MFA device (e.g., the
  Google Authenticator app, RSA key fob, or a YubiKey). This adds a strong second layer of security for your root user,
  as logging in now requires both something you know (the user name and password) and something you have (the
  virtual or physical MFA device). Note that, by default, if you enable MFA for a root user, the MFA token will only be
  required when logging in with the user name and console password in your web browser; you will NOT be required to
  provide an MFA token when logging in programmatically with access keys. If you want to require MFA tokens for
  programmatic access too (*strongly recommended*), you will need to use IAM policies, which are described later.

Root permissions::
  The root user has access permissions to _everything_ in your AWS account. By design, there's almost no way to limit
  those permissions. This is similar in concept to the root or administrator user of an operating system. If your root
  user account gets compromised, the attacker will likely be able to take over everything in your account. Therefore,
  you typically only use the root user during initial setup to create IAM users (the topic of the next section) with
  more limited permissions, and then you'll likely never touch the root user account again.

=== IAM users

In AWS, you use _https://aws.amazon.com/iam/[Identity and Access Management (IAM)]_ to manage access to your AWS
account. One of the things you can do in IAM is create an
_https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html[IAM user]_, which is an account a human being can use
to access AWS.

User name::
  Every IAM user in your AWS account must have a unique _user name_.

Console password::
  Each IAM user can optionally have a _console password_. The user name and console password allows you to login as an
  IAM user to your AWS account in a web browser by using the IAM user sign-in URL.

IAM user sign-in URL::
  Every AWS account has a unique
  _https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_how-users-sign-in.html[IAM user sign-in URL]_. Note
  that to login as an IAM user, you do NOT go to https://console.aws.amazon.com, as that's solely the sign-in URL for
  root users. Instead, IAM users will need to use a sign-in URL of the form
  `\https://<ID_OR_ALIAS>.signin.aws.amazon.com/console`, where `ID_OR_ALIAS` is either your AWS account ID (e.g.,
  `\https://111122223333.signin.aws.amazon.com/console`) or a
  _https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html[custom account alias]_ that you pick for
  your AWS account (e.g., `\https://my-custom-alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console`). Whenever you create a new IAM
  user, make sure to send that IAM user their user name, console password, and the IAM user sign-in URL.

Access keys::
  Each IAM user can optionally have a set of
  _https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys[access keys]_,
  which are the credentials you use to login to your AWS account programmatically (e.g., on the command line or when
  making API calls). Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID (for example, `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`) and a
  secret access key (for example, `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`).

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)::
  Each IAM user can enable
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html[Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)] (*strongly
  recommended*), which will require you to provide not only the user name and console password when logging in, but
  also a temporary, one-time token generated by either a virtual or physical MFA device (e.g., the Google Authenticator
  app, RSA key fob, or a YubiKey). This adds a strong second layer of security for your IAM user, as logging in now
  requires both something you know (the user name and password) and something you have (the virtual or physical MFA
  device).

Password policy::
  You can configure a
  _https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_passwords_account-policy.html[password policy]_
  in your AWS account to enforce requirements on console passwords, such as minimum length, use of special characters,
  and password expiration.

Permissions::
  By default, a new IAM user does not have permissions to do anything in the AWS account
  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege[principle of least privilege]). In order to grant this
  user permissions, you will need to use IAM policies, which are the topic of the next section.

=== IAM policies

You can use _https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html[IAM policies]_ to define permissions
in your AWS account.

IAM policy basics::
  Each IAM policy is a JSON document that consists of one or more _statements_, where each statement can allow or deny
  specific _principals_ (e.g., IAM users) to perform specific _actions_ (e.g., `ec2:StartInstances`, `s3:GetObject`) on
  specific _resources_ (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets). Here's an example IAM policy that allows an IAM user named
  `Bob` to perform `s3:GetObject` on an S3 bucket called `examplebucket`:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Principal": {"AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/Bob"]},
      "Action":["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
----

Managed policies::
  Each AWS account comes with a number of
  _https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html[managed policies]_, which
  are pre-defined IAM policies created and maintained by AWS. These included policies such as `AdministratorAccess`
  (full access to everything in an AWS account), `ReadOnlyAccess` (read-only access to everything in an AWS account),
  `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess` (read-only access to solely EC2 resources in an AWS account), and many others. AWS managed
  policies are owned by AWS and cannot be modified or removed.

Customer-managed policies::
  While managed policies give you coarse-grained, generic permissions, to get more fine-grained, custom permissions,
  you can create custom IAM policies (known as _customer-managed policies_).

Standalone policies::
  A _standalone policy_ is an IAM policy that exists by itself and can be attached to other IAM entities. For example,
  you could create a single policy that gives access to a specific S3 bucket and _attach_ that policy to several IAM
  users so they all get the same permissions.

Inline policies::
  An _inline policy_ is a policy that's embedded within an IAM entity, and only affects that single entity. For
  example, you could create a policy embedded within an IAM user that gives solely that one user access to a specific
  S3 bucket.

=== IAM groups

An _https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.html[IAM group]_ is a collection of IAM users. You can
attach IAM policies to an IAM group and all the users in that group will inherit the permissions from that policy.
Instead of managing permissions by attaching multiple IAM policies directly to each IAM user—which can become very hard
to maintain as the number of policies and users grows and your organization changes—you can create a relatively fixed
number of groups that represent your company's structure and permissions (e.g., `developers`, `admins`, and `billing`)
and assign each IAM user to the appropriate IAM groups.

=== IAM roles

An _https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html[IAM role]_ is a standalone IAM entity that (a) allows
you to attach IAM policies to it, (b) specify which other IAM entities to trust, and then (c) those other IAM entities
can _assume_ the IAM role to be temporarily get access to the permissions in those IAM policies. The two most common
use cases for IAM roles are:

Service roles::
  Whereas an IAM user allows a human being to access AWS resources, one of the most common use cases for an IAM role is
  to allow a service—e.g., one of your applications, a CI server, or an AWS service—to access specific resources in
  your AWS account. For example, you could create an IAM role that gives access to a specific S3 bucket and allow that
  role to be assumed by one of your EC2 instances. The code running on that EC2 instance will then be able to access
  that S3 bucket without you having to manually copy AWS credentials (i.e., access keys) onto that instance.

Cross account access::
  Another common use case for IAM roles is to grant an IAM entity in one AWS account access to specific resources in
  another AWS account. For example, if you have an IAM user in account `A`, then by default, that IAM user cannot
  access anything in account `B`. However, you could create an IAM role in account `B` that gives access to a specific
  S3 bucket in account `B` and allow that role to be assumed by an IAM user in account `A`. That IAM user will then be
  able to access the contents of the S3 bucket by assuming the IAM role in account `B`. This ability to assume IAM
  roles across different AWS accounts is the critical glue that truly makes a multi AWS account structure possible.

Here are some more details on how IAM roles work:

IAM policies::
  Just as you can attach IAM policies to an IAM user and IAM group, you can attach IAM policies to an IAM role.

Trust policy::
  You must define a _trust policy_ for each IAM role, which is a JSON document (very similar to an IAM policy) that
  specifies who can assume this IAM role. For example, here is a trust policy that allows this IAM role to be assumed
  by an IAM user named `Bob` in AWS account `111122223333`:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/Bob"}
    }
  ]
}
----
+
Note that a trust policy alone does NOT automatically give Bob the ability to assume this IAM role. Cross-account
access always requires permissions in _both_ accounts. So, if Bob is in AWS account `111122223333` and you want him to
have access to an IAM role called `foo` in account `444455556666`, then you need to configure permissions in both
accounts: first, in account `444455556666`, the `foo` IAM role must have a trust policy that gives `sts:AssumeRole`
permissions to account `111122223333`, as shown above; second, in account `111122223333`, you also need to attach an
IAM policy to Bob's IAM user that allows him to assume the `foo` IAM role, which might look like this:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:role/foo"
    }
  ]
}
----

Assuming an IAM role::
  IAM roles do not have a user name, password, or permanent access keys. To use an IAM role, you must _assume_ it by
  making an `AssumeRole` API call (see the
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html[AssumeRole API] and
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/assume-role.html[assume-role CLI command]), which will return
  _temporary access keys_ you can use in follow-up API calls to authenticate as the IAM role. The temporary access keys
  will be valid for 1-12 hours, depending on IAM role settings, after which you must call `AssumeRole` again to fetch
  new keys. Note that to make the `AssumeRole` API call, you must first authenticate to AWS using some other
  mechanism. For example, for an IAM user to assume an IAM role, the workflow looks like this:
+
.The process for assuming an IAM role
image::/assets/img/guides/aws-account/assume-iam-role.png[]
+
The basic steps are:
+
. Authenticate using the IAM user's permanent AWS access keys
. Make the `AssumeRole` API call
. AWS sends back temporary access keys
. You authenticate using those temporary access keys
. Now all of your subsequent API calls will be on behalf of the assumed IAM role, with access to whatever permissions
  are attached to that role

IAM roles and AWS services::
  Most AWS services have native support built-in for assuming IAM roles. For example, you can associate an IAM role
  directly with an EC2 instance, and that instance will automatically assume the IAM role every few hours, making the
  temporary credentials available in
  _https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html#instancedata-data-retrieval[EC2 instance metadata]_.
  Just about every AWS CLI and SDK tool knows how to read and periodically update temporary credentials from EC2
  instance metadata, so in practice, as soon as you attach an IAM role to an EC2 instance, any code running on that EC2
  instance can automatically make API calls on behalf of that IAM role, with whatever permissions are attached to that
  role. This allows you to give code on your EC2 instances IAM permissions without having to manually figure out how to
  copy credentials (access keys) onto that instance. The same strategy works with many other AWS services: e.g., you
  use IAM roles as a secure way to give your Lambda functions, ECS services, Step Functions, and many other AWS
  services permissions to access specific resources in your AWS account.

=== Federated authentication

_https://aws.amazon.com/identity/federation/[Federation]_ allows you to authenticate to your AWS account using an
existing _identity provider (IdP)_, such as Google, Active Directory, or Okta, rather than IAM users. Since just about
every single company already has all their user accounts defined in an IdP, this allows you to avoid having to:

* Duplicate all those user accounts in the form of IAM users
* Maintain and update user accounts in multiple places (e.g., when someone changes teams or leaves the company)
* Manage multiple sets of credentials

There are several ways to configure your AWS account to support _single sign-on (SSO)_, allowing you to authenticate
using the users and credentials from your IdP:

AWS Single Sign-On::
  https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/[AWS Single Sign-On] is a managed service that allows you to configure SSO for
  IdPs that support SAML, such as Active Directory and Google. It provides a simple SSO experience for the AWS web
  console, although
  https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-single-sign-on-now-enables-command-line-interface-access-for-aws-accounts-using-corporate-credentials/[signing in on the command line]
  requires multiple steps, including manually copy/pasting credentials.

Gruntwork Houston::
  Gruntwork Houston allows you to configure SSO for IdPs that support SAML or OAuth, including Active Directory,
  Google, Okta, GitHub, and others. It provides a simple SSO experience for the AWS web console, command-line access,
  VPN access, and SSH access. Houston is currently in private beta, so if you're interested, please
  mailto:info@gruntwork.io[email us to find out how to get access].

=== AWS Organizations

_https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/[AWS Organizations]_ gives you a central way to manage multiple AWS accounts. As
you'll see in <<production_grade_design>>, it's a good idea to use multiple separate AWS accounts to manage separate
environments, and AWS organizations is the best way to create and manage all of those accounts.

Root account::
  The first AWS account you create is the _root account_ (sometimes also called the _master account_). This will be the
  parent account for your organization. This account has powerful permissions over all child accounts, so you should
  strictly limit access to this account to a small number of trusted admins.

Child account::
  You can use AWS Organizations to create one or more _child accounts_ beneath the root account.

Organization unit::
  You can group child accounts into one or more _organization units_. This gives you a logical way to group accounts:
  for example, if your company has multiple business units, then each business unit could be represented by one
  organization unit, and each organization unit can contain multiple child accounts that can be accessed solely by
  members of that business unit.

Consolidated billing::
  All of the billing from the child accounts rolls up to the root account. This allows you to manage all payment
  details in a single account and to get a breakdown of cost by organization unit, child account, service type, etc.

IAM roles::
  When creating a child account, you can configure AWS Organizations to create an IAM role within that account that
  allow users from the root account to access the child account. This allows you to manage the child accounts from the
  parent account without having to create an IAM user in every single child account.

Service control policies::
  You can use
  _https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scp.html[Service control policies (SCPs)]_
  to define the maximum available permissions for a child account, overriding any permissions defined in the child
  account itself. For example, you could use SCPs to completely block a child account from using specific AWS regions
  (e.g., block all regions outside of Europe) or AWS services (e.g., Redshift or Amazon Elasticsearch), perhaps because
  those regions or services do not meet your company's compliance requirements (e.g., PCI, HIPAA, GDPR, etc).

=== CloudTrail

_https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/[AWS CloudTrail]_ is a service you can use to log most of the activity within your
AWS account. CloudTrail automatically maintains an audit log of all API calls for
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-aws-service-specific-topics.html[supported services]
in your AWS account, writing these logs to an S3 bucket, and optionally encrypting the data using
https://aws.amazon.com/kms/[KMS]. It can be a good idea to enable CloudTrail in every AWS account, with the
multi-region feature enabled, as the API call data is useful useful for troubleshooting, investigating security
incidents, and maintaining audit logs for compliance.

=== AWS Config

_https://aws.amazon.com/config/[AWS Config]_ is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of
your https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html[AWS resources]. You can use AWS
Config to ensure that AWS resources are configured in a manner that is in compliance with your company policies or regulatory
requirements. This enables you to simplify compliance auditing, security analysis, change management, and operational
troubleshooting.

The way you specify your company's policies is by using
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config.html[AWS Config Rules] which are expressions of a desired
configuration state, written in code and executed as Lambda functions. When a resource configuration changes, AWS Config fires the
relevant Lambda functions to evaluate whether the configuration changes the state of compliance with the desired configuration. AWS
has developed a set of pre-written rules called https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html[AWS Config Managed Rules],
but you can also author your own https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_develop-rules_nodejs.html[custom rules].

=== GuardDuty

_https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/[Amazon GuardDuty]_ is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious
activity and unauthorized behavior in an AWS account. The service analyzes events across multiple AWS data sources, such as
AWS CloudTrail, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs, and uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat
intelligence to identify and prioritize potential threats.

[[production_grade_design]]
== Production-grade design

With all the core concepts out of the way, let's now discuss how to configure a production-grade AWS account structure
that looks something like this:

.A production-grade AWS account structure
image::/assets/img/guides/aws-account/aws-account-structure.png[]

// TODO: other topics we may wish to cover:
// Compliance: e.g., signing BAA for HIPAA https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/?nc2=h_m1
// A separate "backup" account for disaster recovery

This diagram has many accounts as part of a _multi-account security strategy_. Don't worry if it looks complicated:
we'll break it down piece by piece in the next few sections.

=== The root account

At the top of the design, you have the root account of your AWS organization. This account is not used to run any
infrastructure, and only one or a small number of trusted admins should have IAM users in this account, using it
solely to create and manage child accounts and billing.

Do NOT attach any IAM policies directly to the IAM users; instead, create a set of IAM groups, with specific IAM
policies attached to each group, and assign all of your users to the appropriate groups. The exact set of IAM groups
you need depends on your company's requirements, but for most companies, the root account contains solely a
`full-access` IAM group that gives the handful of trusted users in that account admin permissions, plus a `billing`
IAM group that gives the finance team access to the billing details.

[[child_accounts]]
=== Child accounts

The admins in the root account can create the following child accounts in your AWS organization:

Security account::
  You will want a single _security account_ for managing authentication and authorization. This account is not used to
  run any infrastructure. Instead, this is where you define all of the IAM users and IAM groups for your team (unless
  you're using <<federated_auth>>, as described later). None of the other child accounts will have IAM users; instead,
  those accounts will have IAM roles that can be assumed from the security account. That way, each person on your team
  will have a single IAM user and a single set of credentials in the security account (with the exception of the small
  number of admins who will also have a separate IAM user in the root account) and they will be able to access the
  other accounts by assuming IAM roles.

Application accounts (dev, stage, prod)::
  You can have one or more _application accounts_ for running your software. At a bare minimum, most companies will
  have a production account ("prod"), for running user-facing software, and a staging account ("stage") which is a
  replica of production (albeit with smaller or fewer servers to save money) used for internal testing. Some teams will
  have more pre-prod environments (e.g., dev, qa, uat) and some may find the need for more than one prod account (e.g.,
  a separate account for backup and/or disaster recovery, or separate accounts to separate workloads with and without
  compliance requirements).

Shared-services account::
  The _shared-services account_ is used for infrastructure and data that is shared amongst all the application
  accounts, such as CI servers and artifact repositories. For example, in your shared-services account, you might use
  https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/[ECR] to store Docker images and Jenkins to deploy those Docker images to dev, stage, and
  prod. Since the shared-services account may provide resources to (e.g., application packages) and has access to
  most of your other accounts (e.g., for deployments), including production, from a security perspective, you should
  treat it as a production account, and use at least the same level of precaution when locking everything down.

Sandbox accounts::
  You may want to have one or more _sandbox accounts_ that developers can use for manual testing. The application
  accounts (e.g., dev and stage) are usually shared by the whole company, so these sandbox accounts are intentionally
  kept separate so that developers can feel comfortable deploying and undeploying anything they want without
  fear of affecting someone else (in fact, the gold standard is one sandbox account per developer to keep things 100%
  isolated).

Testing accounts::
  One other type of account that often comes in handy is a _testing account_ that is used specifically for automated
  tests that spin up and tear down lots of AWS infrastructure. For example, at Gruntwork, we use
  https://blog.gruntwork.io/open-sourcing-terratest-a-swiss-army-knife-for-testing-infrastructure-code-5d883336fcd5[Terratest]
  to test all of our infrastructure code, and when testing something like our
  https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault/[Vault modules], we end up spinning up and tearing down a dozen
  Vault and Consul clusters after every single commit. You don't want all this infrastructure churn in your application
  or sandbox accounts, so we recommend having a separate AWS account dedicated for automated tests.

Logs account::
  You will want a single _logs account_ for aggregating log data. All the other accounts—root, security, application
  accounts, shared-services, etc.—will send their AWS Config and CloudTrail data to this account so that you have a
  single, central place where all logs are stored and can be viewed. This account will also contain a KMS customer
  master key (CMK) that is used to encrypt CloudTrail logs.

Note that for larger organizations with multiple separate business units, you may need to repeat the structure above
multiple times. That is, in the root account, you
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_ous.html#create_ou[create an Organization Unit]
for each business unit, and within each Organization Unit, you create a set of application, shared-services, sandbox,
and testing accounts (security and logs accounts are usually shared across the entire organization). It's not unusual
for large organizations to have dozens or even hundreds of AWS accounts.

=== IAM roles for users

Whereas you'll create IAM users within the security account (something we'll discuss shortly), in all the other child
accounts, you'll solely create IAM roles that have a trust policy that allows these IAM roles to be assumed from the
security account.

The exact set of IAM roles you need in each account depends on your company's requirements, but here are some common
ones:

OrganizationAccountAccessRole::
  When creating a new child account using AWS Organizations, this is a role you create automatically that allows the
  admin users in the root account to have admin access to the new child account. This role is useful for initial setup
  of the new child account (e.g., to create other roles in the account) and as a backup in case you somehow lose access
  to the child account (e.g., someone accidentally deletes the other IAM roles in the account). Note that the name of
  this role is configurable, though we generally recommend sticking to a known default such as
  `OrganizationAccountAccessRole`.

allow-full-access-from-other-accounts::
  This IAM role grants full access to everything in the child account. These are essentially admin permissions, so be
  very thoughtful about who has access to this IAM role.

allow-read-only-access-from-other-accounts::
  This IAM role grants read-only access to everything in the child account.

allow-dev-access-from-other-accounts::
  This IAM role grants "developer" access in the child account. The exact permissions your developers need depends
  completely on the use case and the account: e.g., in pre-prod environments, you might give developers full access
  to EC2, ELB, and RDS resources, whereas in prod, you might limit that solely to EC2 resources. For larger teams, you
  will likely have multiple such roles, designing them for specific teams or tasks: e.g.,
  `allow-search-team-access-from-other-accounts`, `allow-frontend-team-access-from-other-accounts`,
  `allow-dba-access-from-other-accounts`, etc.

openvpn-allow-certificate-xxx-for-external-accounts::
+
[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: This role only applies to [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscribers# who have access to
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-openvpn/[package-openvpn].
+
The `openvpn-allow-certificate-requests-for-external-accounts` and
`openvpn-allow-certificate-revocations-for-external-accounts` IAM roles allows users to request and revoke VPN
certificates, respectively, for an OpenVPN server running in the child account. This is part of the Gruntwork
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-openvpn/[package-openvpn] code, which deploys a production-grade OpenVPN
server and allows developers with access to these IAM roles to request VPN certificates (self-service).


=== IAM users and groups

In the security account, you will need to create all the IAM users for your team. Do NOT attach any IAM policies
directly to users; instead, create a set of IAM groups, with specific IAM policies attached to each group, and assign
all of your users to the appropriate groups. The exact set of IAM groups you need depends on your company's
requirements, but here are some common ones:

full-access::
  This IAM group gives users full access to everything in the security account. It should only be used for a small
  number of trusted admins who need to manage the users and groups within this account.

_account-<ACCOUNT>-<ROLE>::
  These IAM groups are how you grant IAM users in the security account access to other child accounts. For each AWS
  account `<ACCOUNT>`, and each IAM role `<ROLE>` in that account, you have a group that grants `sts:AssumeRole`
  permissions for that role: e.g., users you add to the `_account-dev-full-access` group will get `sts:AssumeRole`
  permissions to the `allow-full-access-from-other-accounts` IAM role in the `dev` account (so they will have full
  access to that account) and users you add to the `_account-prod-read-only` group will get `sts:AssumeRole` permissions
  to the `allow-read-only-access-from-other-accounts` IAM role in the `prod` account (so they will have read-only
  access to that account).

ssh-grunt-users and ssh-grunt-sudo-users::
  These IAM groups don't grant any IAM permissions, but instead are used by
  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security/tree/master/modules/ssh-grunt[ssh-grunt] to determine who is allowed
  to SSH to your EC2 instances. Each EC2 instance you launch can configure `ssh-grunt` with the names of the IAM
  group(s) that will be allowed to SSH to the instance, with or without sudo permissions. The group names are
  completely up to you, so you could have many such groups, with whatever names you pick. Once you add an IAM user to
  that group, that user will be able to SSH to the corresponding EC2 instances using their own IAM user name and the
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-ssh-unixes.html#setting-up-ssh-unixes-keys[SSH key associated with their IAM user account].
+
[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: You must be a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscriber# to access `ssh-grunt` in
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/[terraform-aws-security].

=== MFA policy

MFA should be required to access any of your AWS accounts via the web or any API call. Unfortunately, AWS doesn't have
an easy way to enforce MFA globally, and if you try to enforce it in a naive manner, you'll run into issues: e.g., you
might accidentally block access for your own applications (e.g., those that use IAM roles on EC2 instance, where MFA
isn't possible) or you might accidentally block new IAM users from accessing AWS and setting up an MFA token in the
first place.

Therefore, the best way to enforce MFA right now is as follows:

IAM roles::
  All the IAM roles in your non-security child accounts that are meant to be assumed by users should
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_configure-api-require.html#MFAProtectedAPI-user-mfa[require an MFA token in the trust policy].
  Since these IAM roles are the only way to access those child accounts (i.e., there are no IAM users in those child
  accounts), this ensures that it's only possible to access those accounts with MFA enabled. Note: the
  `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` IAM role is created automatically by AWS Organizations, so you'll need to manually
  update it in each child account to require MFA.

IAM users and groups::
  The only place you have IAM users and groups are in the root and security account. None of the user accounts should
  have any IAM policies directly attached, so the only thing to think through is the policies attached to the IAM
  groups. To enforce MFA, make sure that all of these policies
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_configure-api-require.html#MFAProtectedAPI-user-mfa[require an MFA token].
  Note that all of these policies also should attach "self-management" permissions that allow IAM users just enough
  permissions to access their own user account without an MFA token so they can configure an MFA token in the first
  place.

=== Password policy

In any account that has IAM users (which should just be the root and security accounts), configure a password policy
that ensures all IAM users have strong passwords. The exact policy you use depends on your company's requirements (e.g.,
certain compliance requirements may force you to use a specific password policy), but you may want to consider
https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#memsecret[NIST 800-63 guidelines] as a reasonable starting point.

=== IAM roles for services

In addition to the IAM roles you create for users, you will also need to create IAM roles for services, applications,
and automated users in your child accounts. The exact set of IAM roles you need depends on your company's
requirements, but here are some common ones:

allow-auto-deploy-access-from-other-accounts::
  This is an IAM role that grants permissions for automatically deploying (e.g., as part of a CI / CD pipeline)
  some specific service. For example, this role may have a trust policy that allows it to be assumed by a Jenkins
  server in the shared-services account, and gives that server permissions to deploy EC2 Instances and Auto Scaling
  Groups. Note that anyone who has to your CI server (e.g., anyone who can create/modify/execute Jenkins jobs) can
  effectively make use of all the permissions in this IAM role, so be very thoughtful about what this role can do.

allow-ssh-grunt-access-from-other-accounts::
  This is an IAM role that grants permission to look up IAM group membership and the public SSH keys of IAM user
  accounts. Typically, you'd have this role in your security account to allow the EC2 instances in other accounts to
  authenticate SSH attempts using
  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/tree/master/modules/ssh-grunt[ssh-grunt].
+
[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: You must be a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscriber# to access `ssh-grunt` in
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/[terraform-aws-security].

Service roles::
  Most EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and other AWS services you launch will have an IAM role that gives that service
  the permissions it needs to function. For example, the IAM role for the
  https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-consul/tree/master/modules[Consul cluster] gives the EC2 instances in that
  cluster `ec2:DescribeInstances`, `ec2:DescribeTags`, and `autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups` permissions so that
  the instances can look up instance, tag, and auto scaling group information to automatically discover and connect
  to the other instances in the cluster.

A few important notes on IAM roles for services:

No MFA::
  The trust policy in service IAM roles cannot require MFA, as automated services can't use MFA devices. That means you
  need to take extra care in terms of who can assume this IAM role, what permissions the role has, and locking down the
  services. For example, if you have Jenkins running on an EC2 instance, and you give that EC2 instance access to an
  IAM role so it can deploy your apps, you should do your best to minimize the permissions that IAM role has (e.g.,
  to just `ecs` permissions if deploying to ECS) and you should ensure that your Jenkins instance runs in private
  subnets so that it is NOT accessible from the public Internet (see link:/guides/networking/how-to-deploy-production-grade-vpc-aws[How to deploy a production-grade VPC on AWS]).

Use the right Principal::
  The trust policy in service IAM roles will need to specify the appropriate `Principal` to allow an AWS service to
  assume it. For example, if you're running Jenkins on an EC2 instance, and you want that EC2 instance to be able to
  assume an IAM role to get specific permissions (e.g., to get permissions to deploy some code in one of your child
  accounts), you'll need a trust policy that looks like this:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Principal": {"Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"}
    }
  ]
}
----
+
Notice that the `Principal` is set to `"Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"`, whereas previous IAM roles you saw (those
intended for IAM users) used the format `"AWS": "<ARN>"`. Each AWS service has its own `Principal`: e.g., if you
want an IAM role that can be assumed by a Lambda function, the `Principal` will be `"lambda.amazonaws.com"`.

Protecting IAM roles::
  While IAM roles offer a convenient way to give an EC2 instance permissions to make API calls without having to
  manually copy credentials to the EC2 instance, the default security configuration for them is not particularly secure.
  That's because the IAM role is exposed to the code on the EC2 instance through
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html#instancedata-data-retrieval[EC2 instance metadata],
  which is an http endpoint (`\http://169.254.169.254`) that _anyone_ on the EC2 instance can access. That means that
  any compromise of that EC2 instance instantly gives an attacker access to all the permissions in that IAM role. We
  *strongly* recommend mitigating this by limiting access to the endpoint solely to specific OS users (e.g., solely to
  the root user), e.g., by using `iptables`. You can do this automatically using
  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/tree/master/modules/ip-lockdown[ip-lockdown]
+
[source,bash]
----
# Make EC2 instance metadata only accessible to the root user
ip-lockdown "169.254.169.254" "root"
----
+
[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: You must be a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscriber# to access `ip-lockdown` in
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security[terraform-aws-security].

Machine users::
  If you need to give something outside of your AWS account access to your AWS account—for example, if you're using
  CircleCi as your CI server and need to give it a way to deploy code into your AWS accounts—then you will need to
  create a _machine user_. This is an IAM user designed for use solely by an automated service. You create the IAM user
  in the security account, add the user to specific IAM groups that grant the user the permissions it needs, generate
  access keys for the user, and provide those access keys to the external system (e.g., by storing the access keys as
  the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables in CircleCi). Note that you cannot require
  MFA for a machine user, so before giving credentials to an external system, think very carefully if that system is
  worth trusting with access to your AWS account, and limit the machine user's permissions as much as possible.
+
.Machine users are a red flag
NOTE: When you come across a 3rd party service that requires you to create an IAM machine user, you should think of
that as a red flag. Just about all vendors these days should support using IAM roles instead, as creating an IAM role
and giving the vendor permissions to assume that role is significantly more secure than manually copying around
sensitive machine user access keys.

=== CloudTrail

You'll want to enable CloudTrail in every single AWS account so that you have an audit log of the major activity
happening in the account. We typically recommend that you aggregate these logs in the logs account. To do this, you:

. Create an S3 bucket in the logs account, and grant the CloudTrail service in all accounts permissions to write
 to this bucket.
. Create a KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) in the logs account and grant the CloudTrail service in all accounts
  permissions to encrypt data with this CMK.
. Enable CloudTrail in all accounts, configuring it to encrypt data with the CMK in the logs account and write data
  to the S3 bucket in the logs account.
. (Optional) Configure CloudTrail to also send logs to CloudWatch Logs within each account. This gives you an
  additional way to quickly view recent CloudTrail data for an account in the account itself, without having to login
  to the logs account.

=== AWS Config

You'll want to enable AWS Config in every one of your AWS accounts, plus any AWS Config Rules that are relevant to your
company, so that you can track AWS resource configuration changes over time and enforce company policy. Note that you
should enable AWS Config in every AWS region, and not just the region(s) you're using for the rest of your infrastructure.
That way, if an employee (perhaps accidentally), or even worse, an attacker, runs something in a region you don't typically
use, it'll still be recorded in AWS Config, and your rules will still be enforced.

We typically recommend that you aggregate AWS Config data in the logs account. To do this, you:

. Create an S3 bucket in the logs account and grant the AWS Config service in all accounts write access to this
  bucket.
. Enable AWS Config in all accounts, configuring them to send data to the S3 bucket in the logs account.
. Create an SNS topic in each region of the logs account, and set up AWS Config in each region of each account to send SNS notifications to the topic in the corresponding region of the logs account. This is because Config cannot send notifications to topics in other regions.

=== GuardDuty

You'll want to enable GuardDuty in every one of your AWS accounts, so that you can protect both your accounts and workloads
against malicious activity and unauthorized behavior. Note that you should enable GuardDuty in every AWS region, and not just
the region(s) you're using for the rest of your infrastructure. That way, if an employee (perhaps accidentally), or even worse,
an attacker, runs something in a region you don't typically use, you'll still be notified by GuardDuty. We typically recommend
publishing GuardDuty's findings to a dedicated Amazon SNS topic.

[[federated_auth]]
=== Federated auth

If you are using federated auth—that is, you are going to access AWS using an existing IdP such as Google, Active
Directory, or Okta—you should use the same account structure, but with a few changes:

No IAM users or groups::
  Since all of your users will be managed in the IdP, you do not need to create any IAM users or IAM groups (other than
  the handful of IAM users in the root account).

Different IAM role trust policies::
  With federated auth, you will be granting your IdP users access to specific IAM roles in specific accounts.
  Therefore, your child accounts will need more or less all the same basic IAM roles described earlier. However, the
  trust policy on those IAM roles will be quite different. For example, if you are using federated auth with SAML,
  the `Action` you allow will be `sts:AssumeRoleWithSAML` rather than `sts:AssumeRole` and the `Principal` will be your
  SAML provider:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithSAML",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:saml-provider/<YOUR_SAML_PROVIDER>"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

MFA enforced by IdP, not AWS::
  One other big difference with IAM roles for federated auth is that these IAM roles should NOT require an MFA token.
  That's because the MFA token check in AWS IAM policies only works with AWS MFA tokens, and not whatever MFA
  configuration you have with your IdP. With federated auth, AWS fully trusts the IdP to figure out all auth details,
  so if you want to require MFA, you need to do that in the IdP itself (i.e., in Google, Active Directory, or Okta).

[[deployment_walkthrough]]
== Deployment walkthrough

Let's now walk through the step-by-step process of how to create a production-grade AWS account structure using the
Gruntwork AWS Landing Zone solution.

[[pre_requisites]]
=== Pre-requisites

This walkthrough has the following pre-requisites:

Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library::
  This guide uses code from the https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library], as it
  implements most of the production-grade design for you out of the box. Make sure to read
  link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library[How to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library].
+
[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: You must be a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscriber# to access the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library.

Terraform::
  This guide uses https://www.terraform.io/[Terraform] to define and manage all the infrastructure as code. If you're
  not familiar with Terraform, check out https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-terraform-b3d32832baca[A
  Comprehensive Guide to Terraform], https://training.gruntwork.io/p/terraform[A Crash Course on Terraform], and
  link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library[How to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library].

Terragrunt::
  This guide uses https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/[Terragrunt] to configure the infrastructure as code. To get familiar
  with Terragrunt, explore the https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/#features[features], read the https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/[guides],
  or dive into the https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/[documentation].

Code repository::
  You will need to initialize an `infrastructure-live` repository to contain all of the Terragrunt configuration code for your
  infrastructure. You may use the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/v0.41.4/examples/for-production/infrastructure-live[`for-production` example code] to start with.

Keybase (optional)::
  As part of this guide, you will create IAM users, including, optionally, credentials for those IAM users. If you
  choose to create credentials, those credentials will be encrypted with a PGP key. You could provide the PGP keys
  manually, but a more manageable option may be to have your team members to sign up for https://keybase.io[Keybase],
  create PGP keys for themselves, and then you can provide their Keybase usernames, and the PGP keys will be retrieved
  automatically.


=== Prepare your `infrastructure-live` repository

[NOTE]
.Terragrunt not required
====
This guide uses https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt[Terragrunt] and its associated file and folder
structure to deploy Terraform modules. Please note that *Terragrunt is NOT required for using Terraform modules from
the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library.* Check out link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library[How to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library]
for instructions on alternative options, such as
link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library#deploy_using_plain_terraform[deploying with plain Terraform].
====

Now we're going to make some HCL files that store variables to be used across your modules. _You won't be able to fill
everything out just yet._ Your AWS account IDs will be generated after applying the `account-baseline-root` to the root
account. At that point you can update these files. Create them now to have them ready to use.

For example, assuming `us-east-1` is your default region, your directory structure would look like the following, with
`_global` and `<region>` directories in each account directory:

----
infrastructure-live
  └ common.hcl
  └ accounts.json
  └ terragrunt.hcl
  └ dev
  └ logs
  └ stage
  └ security
  └ shared
  └ prod
    └ _global
      └ region.hcl
    └ us-east-1
      └ region.hcl
----

The Terraform modules in the link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/[Service Catalog]
do not define some blocks that are required for Terraform to operate (e.g., the `provider` and `terraform`
state backend blocks). This is to allow the modules to be flexibly used in different contexts.
We'll define a root `terragrunt.hcl` that injects these these required blocks.

Create a `terragrunt.hcl` at the root of your infrastructure-live repo and insert the following contents. As you can
see, it references `common`, `account`, and `region` HCL files which we'll create shortly.

.infrastructure-live/terragrunt.hcl

Also create a `common.hcl` file at the root of your `infrastructure-live` repo, with the following contents.

.infrastructure-live/common.hcl
[source,hcl]
----
locals {
  # TODO: Enter a unique name prefix to set for all resources created in your accounts, e.g., your org name.
  name_prefix = ""

  default_region = ""

  # TODO: Fill these in after applying the account-baseline-root to the root account.
  config_s3_bucket_name      = ""
  cloudtrail_s3_bucket_name  = ""
  cloudtrail_kms_key_arn     = ""

  # TODO: An accounts map to conveniently store all account IDs.
  # Centrally define all the AWS account IDs. We use JSON so that it can be readily parsed outside of Terraform.
  accounts = jsondecode(file("accounts.json"))
}
----

This file references an `accounts.json`, which you should also create at the root of the repo. _You will fill out
the account IDs after applying the account-baseline-root to the root account._

In each account folder (e.g., `infrastructure-live/dev`, `infrastructure-live/shared`, etc.), add a file named
`account.hcl` with the following contents. _Leave `account_id` blank until after the `account-baseline-root` has been
applied to the root account._

[source,hcl]
----
locals {
  # TODO: Update with the actual information of each account
  # The user friendly name of the AWS account. Usually matches the folder name.
  account_name = ""
  # The 12 digit ID number of your AWS account.
  account_id = ""
}
----

Now in each `infrastructure-live/<account_name>/_global/` folder, create a `region.hcl` file.

[source,hcl]
----
# Modules in the account _global folder don't live in any specific AWS region, but you still have to send the API calls
# to _some_ AWS region, so here we use the default region for those API calls.
locals {
  aws_region = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("common.hcl")).locals.default_region
}
----

Do the same in each region folder (e.g., `infrastructure-live/dev/us-east-1/`). This `region.hcl` file is a bit different.

[source,hcl]
----
locals {
# TODO: Enter the region to use for all resources in this subfolder.
  aws_region = ""
}
----


=== Create the root account

Now let's create your root AWS account. This account will be the parent of all of your other AWS accounts and
the central place where you manage billing. You create this initial account manually, via a web browser:

. Go to https://aws.amazon.com.
. Click Create an AWS Account.
. Go through the sign up flow, entering contact and billing details as requested.
. You will be asked to enter an email address and password to use as the credentials for the root user of this root
  account.

[[lock_down_root_user]]
=== Lock down the root user

After signing up for an AWS account, you'll be logged in as the root user. The root user has unrestricted access to
just about everything in your AWS account (and any child accounts), so if an attacker compromises your root user, the
results can be catastrophic for your company. Therefore, you should lock down the root user as much as possible:

Use a secrets manager::
  Do NOT store the root user's password, or secrets of any kind, in plain text. Instead, always use a secrets manager
  such as https://1password.com[1Password], https://www.lastpass.com[LastPass], or https://www.passwordstore.org[pass]
  to store the credentials in an encrypted format.

Use a strong, generated password::
  Do NOT re-use passwords from other websites, or any password that you can remember at all. Instead, generate a random,
  cryptographically secure, long password (20+ characters) for the root user. All the password managers mentioned above
  can generate and store passwords for you in one step, so use them!

Enable MFA::
  Make sure to
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html#id_root-user_manage_mfa[enable MFA for your root user].
  Feel free to use a virtual or hardware MFA device—whichever is easier or required by your company—as either one
  dramatically improves the security of your root user.

Disable access keys::
  Make sure to
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html#id_root-user_manage_delete-key[delete the root user's access keys],
  so that the only way to login as the root user is via the web console, where MFA is required.

Don't use the root user again::
  In the next section, you will create an IAM user in the root account with admin permissions. Once you've created that
  IAM user, you should do everything as that IAM user, and more or less never touch the root user account again.
  The only time you'll need it is for account recovery situations (e.g., you accidentally deleted the IAM user or lost
  your credentials) or for the
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tasks-that-require-root.html[small number of tasks that require root user credentials].

[[create_iam_user_in_root]]
=== Create an IAM user in the root account

As the last action you do as the root user, you MUST create an IAM user. This is not only a better practice from a
security standpoint, but also, the `account-baseline-xxx` modules we will use below assume IAM roles, which does not
work with a root user. Later on, we'll create and manage all IAM users as code, but you should create this very first
IAM user manually by
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console[following these instructions]:

. Enter a username for your IAM user.
. Select both "programmatic access" and "AWS Management Console access."
. On the next page, click "Attach existing policies to user directly" and attach the `AdministratorAccess` policy.
. Click next a few more times to create the IAM user.
. In a secrets manager, save the IAM sign-in URL, your IAM user's username, the password, and your Access Keys.

[[lock_down_iam_users]]
=== Lock down the root account IAM users

Although IAM users don't have the same powers as a root user, having an IAM user account compromised can still be a
huge problem for your company (especially if that IAM user had admin permissions), so it's still critical to lock down
IAM user accounts as much as possible:

Use a secrets manager::
  Do NOT store the credentials or any kind of secret in plain text. Instead, always use a secrets manager such as
  https://1password.com[1Password], https://www.lastpass.com[LastPass], or https://www.passwordstore.org[pass] to store
  the credentials in an encrypted format.

Use a strong, generated password::
  Do NOT re-use passwords from other websites, or any password that you can remember at all. Instead, generate a random,
  cryptographically secure, long password (20+ characters). All the password managers mentioned above can generate and
  store passwords for you in one step, so use them!

Enable MFA::
  Always make sure to
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable.html[enable MFA for your IAM user].
  Feel free to use a virtual or hardware MFA device—whichever is easier or required by your company—as either one
  dramatically improves the security of your IAM user. Note that using SMS (text messages) for MFA is
  https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/08/nist_is_no_long.html[no longer recommended by NIST] due to known
  https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/18/16328172/sms-two-factor-authentication-hack-password-bitcoin[vulnerabilities with the cellular system],
  so using a virtual or hardware MFA device is preferable; that said, MFA with SMS is still better than no MFA at all.

=== Configure the security baseline for the root account

Next, we'll configure a security baseline for the root account that is responsible for creating all the child accounts.
It will also configure AWS Organizations, IAM Roles, IAM Users, IAM Groups, IAM Password Policies, Amazon GuardDuty,
AWS CloudTrail, and AWS Config.

We'll be using the `account-baseline-root` module from https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog[terraform-aws-service-catalog].

[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: You must be a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscriber# to access `terraform-aws-service-catalog`.

==== Set up the inputs for `account-baseline` for the root account

Next, create a `terragrunt.hcl` file in `infrastructure-live`. It should go under the file path `root/_global/account-baseline`:

----
infrastructure-live
  └ root
    └ _global
      └ account-baseline
        └ terragrunt.hcl
----

Define the `terraform` block with the source pointing to the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog[terraform-aws-service-catalog account-baseline-root] module.

.infrastructure-live/root/_global/account-baseline/terragrunt.hcl
[source,hcl]
----
terraform {
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog.git//modules/landingzone/account-baseline-root?ref=v0.41.4"

  # This module deploys some resources (e.g., AWS Config) across all AWS regions, each of which needs its own provider,
  # which in Terraform means a separate process. To avoid all these processes thrashing the CPU, which leads to network
  # connectivity issues, we limit the parallelism here.
  extra_arguments "parallelism" {
    commands  = get_terraform_commands_that_need_parallelism()
    arguments = ["-parallelism=2"]
  }
}
----


[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: We **strongly** recommend setting Terraform parallelism to a low value (i.e., `-parallelism=2`), as shown above, with the `account-baseline-xxx` modules. This is because these modules deploy multi-region resources (e.g., GuardDuty, AWS Config, etc), and for each region, Terraform spins up a separate process, so if you don't limit the parallelism, it may peg all your CPU cores and lead to network connectivity errors.

Set the variables for the `account-baseline-root` module in this environment in the `inputs = { ... }` block.

.infrastructure-live/root/_global/account-baseline/terragrunt.hcl
[source,hcl]
----
inputs = {
  # If you've already created an AWS Organization in your root account, you'll be able to import it later in this guide
  create_organization = true

  # The child AWS accounts to create in this AWS organization
  child_accounts = {
    logs = {
      email = "root-accounts+logs@acme.com"

      # Mark this account as the logs account, used to aggregate all AWS Config and CloudTrail data.
      is_logs_account = true
    },
    security = {
      email = "root-accounts+security@acme.com"
    },
    shared = {
      email = "root-accounts+shared@acme.com"
    },
    dev = {
      email = "root-accounts+dev@acme.com"
    },
    stage = {
      email = "root-accounts+stage@acme.com"
    },
    prod = {
      email = "root-accounts+prod@acme.com"
    }
  }

  # The IAM users to create in this account. Since this is the root account, you should only create IAM users for a
  # small handful of trusted admins.
  #
  # NOTE: Make sure to include the IAM user you created manually here! We'll import the user into Terraform state in
  # the next step of this guide, allowing you to manage this user as code going forward.
  users = {
    alice = {
      groups               = ["full-access"]
      pgp_key              = "keybase:alice"
      create_login_profile = true
      create_access_keys   = false
    },
    bob = {
      groups               = ["billing"]
      pgp_key              = "keybase:bob"
      create_login_profile = true
      create_access_keys   = false
    }
  }
}
----

The example code above does the following:

. **Create 6 child AWS accounts**. These are the accounts described in the <<child_accounts>> sections.

. **Associate an email address with each of the child accounts**. This will be the email address for the root user of
  each account and AWS requires that the root user's email address is _globally_ unique, so it cannot be the email
  address you used for the root account or any of the other child accounts. You'll have to either create multiple email
  accounts in your company's email system, or, if your company uses Gmail (perhaps as part of G Suite), you can take
  advantage of the fact that https://gmail.googleblog.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html[Gmail
  ignores everything after a plus sign in an email address], so that while AWS will see
  `root-accounts+security@your-company.com`, `root-accounts+shared@your-company.com`, and
  `root-accounts+dev@your-company.com` as three unique email addresses, Gmail will see them all as the same email
  address, `root-accounts@your-company.com`.

. **Mark one of the child accounts as a logs account**. We set `is_logs_account = true` on one of the child accounts
  to indicate it is the logs account where we will aggregate AWS Config and CloudTrail data from all the other accounts.
  The `account-baseline-root` module will automatically create an S3 bucket for AWS Config and an S3 bucket and KMS CMK
  for CloudTrail in this account and configure the root account to send all the AWS Config and CloudTrail data to these
  S3 buckets. Later on, you'll configure all the other accounts to send their data to these S3 buckets too.

. **Create IAM groups**. By default, `account-baseline-root` will create a `full-access` IAM group (for admins) and a
  `billing` IAM group (for the finance team).

. **Create IAM users**. For this example, we create `alice` and `bob`, and `carol`, adding `alice` to the `full-access`
  IAM group and `carol` to the `billing` IAM group. _Note_: your own IAM user (the one you created manually) should be
  in the `users` list; we'll use the `import` command to put this user under Terraform management shortly.

. **Generate a password for each user**. We encrypt this password with that user’s PGP key from Keybase (we’ll come
  back to how to handle the passwords shortly).

Pull in the https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/[backend] settings from a root `terragrunt.hcl` file that you
`include` in each child `terragrunt.hcl`. The file you created earlier in `infrastructure-live/terragrunt.hcl` will be pulled.

.infrastructure-live/root/_global/account-baseline/terragrunt.hcl
[source,hcl]
----
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
----

Next, you need to authenticate as your IAM user in the root account. There are
https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-authenticating-to-aws-on-the-command-line-63656a686799[multiple ways to authenticate to AWS on the CLI];
in this guide, we'll use the open source tool https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault[aws-vault].
https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault#installing[Install aws-vault] and add to it the Access Keys you saved earlier
from your IAM user:

[source,bash]
----
$ aws-vault add root-iam-user
Enter Access Key Id: XXXXXXXXXXXX
Enter Secret Key: YYYYYYYYYYYY
----

Next, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html[install the AWS CLI], and check that
authentication is working:

[source,bash]
----
aws-vault exec root-iam-user -- aws sts get-caller-identity
----

You should get JSON output with information about your IAM user:

[source,json]
----
{
  "UserId": "AIDAXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "Account": "<ROOT_ACCOUNT_ID>",
  "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::<ROOT_ACCOUNT_ID>:user/<YOUR_IAM_USER>"
}
----

You're now almost ready to deploy the `account-baseline` module in the root account. But first, let's import the IAM user
and any other existing resources.


=== Import existing resources from the root account into Terraform state

Before applying the `account-baseline-root` module to the root account, we need to import existing resources—including
the IAM user you created manually earlier—into Terraform state, so that Terraform manages those resources instead of
trying to create totally new ones. You can do this using the
https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html[`import` command], which uses the format:

[source,bash]
----
terraform import <ADDRESS> <ID>
----

Where `<ADDRESS>` is the https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/resource-addressing.html[address] of the Terraform
resource you're importing and `<ID>` is a resource-specific identifier (e.g., for `aws_instance`, it's the instance ID,
whereas for `aws_lb`, it's the load balancer's name—check the docs for the resource to find out what to use).

Let's import the IAM user you created manually in the root account. IAM users are managed using the
`aws_iam_user` resource, and the
https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/iam_user#import[documentation for that
resource] tells us to use the user's `name` as the `<ID>`; we'll assume for this example that your IAM user's name was
`alice`, who is already one of the entries in the `users` variable in `terragrunt.hcl`. So now we need the `<ADDRESS>`.
An easy way to get it is to run `plan`:

[source,bash]
----
cd infrastructure-live/root/_global/account-baseline
aws-vault exec root-iam-user -- terragrunt plan
----

You should get a whole bunch of log output, including something that looks like this:

----
------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
 <= read (data resources)

Terraform will perform the following actions:

# ... (ommitting lots of log output for simplicity) ...

# module.root_baseline.module.iam_users.aws_iam_user.user["alice"] will be created
  + resource "aws_iam_user" "user" {
      + arn           = (known after apply)
      + force_destroy = true
      + id            = (known after apply)
      + name          = "alice"
      + path          = "/"
      + unique_id     = (known after apply)
    }

# ... (ommitting lots of log output for simplicity) ...

Plan: 160 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.
----

This `plan` output is telling you that Terraform will create a bunch of resources, including the `aws_iam_user` named
`alice`. Of course, this user already exists, so we want to `import` the user rather than create it again. The text
next to the `#` gives you the `<ADDRESS>` to use:

----
# module.root_baseline.module.iam_users.aws_iam_user.user["alice"] will be created
----

So the `<ADDRESS>` you want is `module.root_baseline.module.iam_users.aws_iam_user.user["alice"]`. Now, normally, you'd
run `import` right away, but due two Terraform bugs, https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13018[#13018] and
https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26211[#26211], `import` doesn't work on certain types of modules—namely,
those with nested `provider` blocks that use dynamic data—and will produce an error like `unknown variable accessed:
var.region in:`. One of these bugs has been open for over 3 years, so we built a workaround for it in Terragrunt: the
https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#aws-provider-patch[`aws-provider-patch` command].

The idea behind the workaround is to temporarily hard-code the dynamic data in nested `provider` blocks. In particular,
we need to temporarily hard-code some of the `region` and `role_arn` parameters of the nested `provider` blocks used by
`account-baseline-root` as follows:

[source,bash]
----
terragrunt aws-provider-patch \
  --terragrunt-override-attr region="eu-west-1" \
  --terragrunt-override-attr assume_role.role_arn=""
----

_Note: You can use any region you want for the `region` parameter. It's just temporary. However, `role_arn` must be set
to an empty string or Terraform will complain._

After running this command, you can finally import your IAM user:

[source,bash]
----
aws-vault exec root-iam-user -- terragrunt import \
  'module.root_baseline.module.iam_users.aws_iam_user.user["alice"]' \
  'alice'
----

You should see log output that looks something like this:

----
[terragrunt] 2020/10/13 14:19:16 Running command: terraform import module.root_baseline.module.iam_users.aws_iam_user.user["alice"] alice
module.root_baseline.module.iam_users.aws_iam_user.user["alice"]: Importing from ID "alice"...
module.root_baseline.module.iam_users.aws_iam_user.user["alice"]: Import prepared!
  Prepared aws_iam_user for import
module.root_baseline.module.iam_users.aws_iam_user.user["alice"]: Refreshing state... [id=alice]

Import successful!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
----

You'll now be able to manage that IAM user as code going forward!

If you created other resources manually in the root account, you may want to `import` them too, so you can manage
everything as code, and so that Terraform doesn't try to create any duplicate resources. For example, if you already
manually created an AWS Organization in your root account, you'll need to import it using a command that looks like
this:

[source,bash]
----
aws-vault exec root-iam-user -- terragrunt import \
  'module.root_baseline.module.organization.aws_organizations_organization.root[0]' \
  '<ORG_ID>'
----

Where `<ORG_ID>` is the ID of your AWS Organization. Note that this is NOT the same as the AWS account ID, but a
separate ID you can find by going to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/home[AWS Organizations] page in
the AWS console, clicking on your root account (the one with a star to the left of it), and looking at the root
account's ARN, which will look something like, `arn:aws:organizations::<ACCOUNT_ID>:account/<ORG_ID>/<ACCOUNT_ID>`. The
`<ORG_ID>` is the part between slashes, and it'll look something like `o-a2lce3bbqq`.

You may also want to import child accounts you created manually. You'll need to add each of these to the
`child_accounts` variable in `terragrunt.hcl`, and you can then import each one as follows:

[source,bash]
----
aws-vault exec root-iam-user -- terragrunt import \
  'module.root_baseline.module.organization.aws_organizations_account.child_accounts["<ACCOUNT_NAME>"]' \
  '<ACCOUNT_ID>'
----

Where `<ACCOUNT_NAME>` is the name you used for the account in the `child_accounts` variable and `<ACCOUNT_ID>` is the
12-digit ID of that AWS account.

Once you're done importing, you'll want to undo the `aws-provider-patch` workaround. The easiest way to do that is to
delete the `.terraform` or `.terragrunt-cache` folders to remove any locally cached modules, as they would've been
modified by the `aws-provider-patch` command.

[source,bash]
----
rm -rf .terragrunt-cache
----

=== Apply the security baseline to the root account

You're now ready to apply the security baseline to the root account. You should be authenticated as the same IAM user
in the root account as in the previous two sections. To apply the security baseline, you run `terragrunt apply`:

[source,bash]
----
cd infrastructure-live/root/_global/account-baseline
aws-vault exec root-iam-user -- terragrunt apply
----

[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: On some operating systems, such as MacOS, you may also need to increase your open files limit to avoid "pipe: too many open files" errors by running: `ulimit -n 10240`.

Once `apply` completes, you should see output variables with all of your account IDs, the name of the AWS Config S3
bucket, the name of the CloudTrail S3 bucket, and the ARN of the CloudTrail KMS key:

[source,hcl]
----
# (This output has been truncated to be easier to read)
child_accounts = {
  "dev" = {
    "email" = "root-accounts+dev@acme.com"
    "id" = "<DEV_ACCOUNT_ID>"
    # (...)
  }
  "logs" = {
    "email" = "root-accounts+logs@acme.com"
    "id" = "<LOGS_ACCOUNT_ID>"
    # (...)
  }
  "prod" = {
    "email" = "root-accounts+prod@acme.com"
    "id" = "<PROD_ACCOUNT_ID>"
    # (...)
  }
  "security" = {
    "email" = "root-accounts+security@acme.com"
    "id" = "<SECURITY_ACCOUNT_ID>"
    # (...)
  }
  "shared" = {
    "email" = "root-accounts+shared@acme.com"
    "id" = "<SHARED_SERVICES_ACCOUNT_ID>"
    # (...)
  }
  "stage" = {
    "email" = "root-accounts+stage@acme.com"
    "id" = "<STAGE_ACCOUNT_ID>"
    # (...)
  }
}
cloudtrail_kms_key_arn    = "<CLOUDTRAIL_KMS_KEY_ARN>"
cloudtrail_s3_bucket_name = "<CLOUDTRAIL_BUCKET_NAME>"
config_s3_bucket_name     = "<CONFIG_BUCKET_NAME>"
----

Now, you can update the `accounts.json` file with the account IDs from the Terraform output! Also `account.hcl` files
located in each account folder (e.g., infrastructure-live/dev, infrastructure-live/shared, etc.), with the appropriate
account ID shown in the Terraform output.

Also update the entries for `cloudtrail_kms_key_arn`, `cloudtrail_s3_bucket_name`, and `config_s3_bucket_name` into your
`infrastructure-live/common.hcl` file, because you'll need these values for every account in the steps below.

One other useful output are the encrypted passwords for IAM users you created:

[source,hcl]
----
user_passwords = {
  "alice" = "wcBMA7E6Kn/t1YPfAQgAVSXlUzumcs4UyO8E5q099YnnU="
  "bob" = "wcBMA7E6Kn/t1YPfAQgACgbdb1mYtQx7EL4hnVWtYAi="
}
----

Send the encrypted password to each user, along with their user name, and the IAM user sign-in URL for the root account.
Each user can then decrypt the password on their own computer (which should have their PGP key) as follows:

[source,bash]
----
echo "<PASSWORD>" | base64 --decode | keybase pgp decrypt
----

=== Reset the root user password in each child account

When creating the child accounts, you may have noticed that you provided an email address for each root user, but
confusingly, not a password. So how do you login as the root user then? It's not obvious, but the answer is that you
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys_retrieve.html#reset-root-password[reset the root user password],
using the "Forgot your password?" prompt on the https://console.aws.amazon.com/[root user login page]. AWS will email
you a reset link, which you can click to go to a page that will allow you to configure a password for the root user.
Use this process to reset the password for the root user of each child account you created.

=== Lock down the root user in the child accounts

Once you're able to access the root user of each child account, you should follow the steps in <<lock_down_root_user>>
for each of those child accounts—including enabling MFA and deleting the root user's access keys—and (almost) never use
those root users again.

=== Apply the security baseline to the logs account

The next step is to configure the logs account, which is used to aggregate AWS Config and CloudTrail data from all the
other accounts.

Create a `terragrunt.hcl` file in `infrastructure-live` under the file path `logs/_global/account-baseline`:

----

  └ root
  └ logs
    └ _global
      └ account-baseline
        └ terragrunt.hcl

Point the `source` URL in your `terragrunt.hcl` file to the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/v0.41.4/modules/landingzone/account-baseline-app[account-baseline-app] service in the Service Catalog.

The example above configures the logs account of an AWS Organization as follows:

. **Aggregate CloudTrail Logs**: We configure the logs account to use the S3 bucket and KMS CMK for CloudTrail that
  were already created by `account-baseline-root`.

. **Aggregate AWS Config**: We configure the logs account to use the S3 bucket for AWS Config that was already
  created by `account-baseline-root`.

. **Allow access from the security account**: We configure IAM roles that IAM users in the security account will be
  able to assume to get access to the logs account.

You're now going to use an IAM role to authenticate to the logs account. This IAM role is created automatically in each
child account by `account-baseline-root` and has a default name of `OrganizationAccountAccessRole`. There are many ways
to https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-authenticating-to-aws-on-the-command-line-63656a686799[assume an IAM role on the CLI];
for this guide, we're going to keep using `aws-vault`.

Open up `~/.aws/config` and you should see a `profile` that was created automatically when you ran
`aws-vault add root-iam-user` earlier:

[source,text]
----
[profile root-iam-user]
----

Add a new `profile` entry in `~/.aws/config` for your logs account that uses the `root-iam-user` as the
`source_profile`:

[source,text]
----
[profile logs-from-root]
role_arn=arn:aws:iam::<LOGS_ACCOUNT_ID>:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole
source_profile=root-iam-user
----

Check that you're able to authenticate to the logs account:

[source,bash]
----
aws-vault exec logs-from-root -- aws sts get-caller-identity
----

You should see JSON output indicating that you've successfully assumed an IAM role:

[source,json]
----
{
  "UserId": "AIDAXXXXXXXXXXXX:1597932316055520000",
  "Account": "<LOGS_ACCOUNT_ID>",
  "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::<LOGS_ACCOUNT_ID>:assumed-role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole/1597932316055520000"
}
----

You're now ready to deploy the `account-baseline` module in the logs account by running `terragrunt apply`:

[source,bash]
----
cd infrastructure-live/logs/_global/account-baseline
aws-vault exec logs-from-root -- terragrunt apply
----

IMPORTANT: On some operating systems, such as MacOS, you may also need to increase your open files limit to avoid "pipe: too many open files" errors by running: `ulimit -n 10240`.

=== Apply the security baseline to the security account

Now that your logs accounts is fully configured, you need to apply the security baseline to the security account, which
is where all your IAM users and groups will be defined and managed.

The code above does the following:

. **Enable CloudTrail**. We've configured CloudTrail to use the S3 bucket and KMS CMK in the logs account.

. **Enable AWS Config**. We've configured AWS Config to use the S3 bucket in the logs account.

. **Create IAM groups**. We've created IAM groups, both for permissions within the security account (e.g.,
  `full-access` grants admin permissions in the security account) and for permissions in other accounts (e.g.,
  `_account.stage-full-access` grants access to an IAM role with admin permissions in the stage account). Be sure to
  fill out the section for permissions in dev, prod, logs, and shared-services accounts.

. **Create IAM users**. The example above creates IAM users for `alice`, `bob`, and `carol`, and assigns them to
  the various IAM groups. You should create an IAM user for yourself in the `full-access` group, plus IAM users for the
  rest of your team in the appropriate groups. Like the root account, the code will also generate a password for each
  user and encrypt it with that user’s PGP key from Keybase (see below for how to handle the passwords).

Just as with the logs account, you're going to use the `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` IAM role created by
`account-baseline-root` to authenticate to the security account. There are many ways to
https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-authenticating-to-aws-on-the-command-line-63656a686799[assume an IAM role on the CLI];
for this guide, we're going to keep using `aws-vault`.

Add a new `profile` entry in `~/.aws/config` for your security account that uses the `root-iam-user` as the
`source_profile`:

[source,text]
----
[profile security-from-root]
role_arn=arn:aws:iam::<SECURITY_ACCOUNT_ID>:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole
source_profile=root-iam-user
----

Check that you're able to authenticate to the security account:

[source,bash]
----
aws-vault exec security-from-root -- aws sts get-caller-identity
----

You should see JSON output indicating that you've successfully assumed an IAM role:

[source,json]
----
{
  "UserId": "AIDAXXXXXXXXXXXX:1597932316055520000",
  "Account": "<SECURITY_ACCOUNT_ID>",
  "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::<SECURITY_ACCOUNT_ID>:assumed-role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole/1597932316055520000"
}
----

You're now ready to deploy the `account-baseline` module in the security account by running `terragrunt apply`:

[source,bash]
----
cd infrastructure-live/security/_global/account-baseline
aws-vault exec security-from-root -- terragrunt apply
----

[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: On some operating systems, such as MacOS, you may also need to increase your open files limit to avoid "pipe: too many open files" errors by running: `ulimit -n 10240`.

When `apply` finishes, the module will output the encrypted passwords for the users defined above. Send the encrypted
password to each user, along with their user name, and the IAM user sign-in URL for the account. Each user can then
decrypt the password on their own computer (which should have their PGP key) as follows:

[source,bash]
----
echo "<PASSWORD>" | base64 --decode | keybase pgp decrypt
----

=== Apply the security baseline to the other child accounts

Now that your security account is fully configured, you need to apply the security baseline to the remaining child
accounts (i.e., dev, stage, prod, and shared, plus sandbox and testing accounts you might have) as
detailed in the <<child_accounts>> section. Feel free to adjust this as necessary based on the accounts your company
needs.

The `account-baseline-app` module in the Service Catalog can be used interchangeably between app accounts and log
accounts as they deploy most of the same resources. That means this module can be re-used for all of the child
accounts.

Create `terragrunt.hcl` files in `infrastructure-live` under the file paths `<ACCOUNT>/_global/account-baseline`,
where `<ACCOUNT>` is one of these other child accounts, such as dev, stage, prod, and shared. In the rest of
this example, we’ll look solely at the stage account, but make sure you follow the analogous steps for EACH of your
child accounts.

. **Configure the dev IAM role**. We create a `dev` IAM role in this account, which will get read and write access to
  the services specified in `dev_permitted_services`.

. **Configure the Auto Deploy IAM role**. We also create an `auto-deploy` IAM role that can be assumed by a CI server
  in the shared-services account to do deployments. This role will have the permissions specified in
  `auto_deploy_permissions`.

. **Configure cross-account IAM roles**. We then specify which other accounts are allowed to assume the IAM roles in
  this account. For the most part, we grant all permissions to the security account, so that by assigning users to IAM
  groups in that account, you'll be able to access IAM roles in all the other child accounts.

Just as with the logs and security accounts, you're going to use the `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` IAM role created by
`account-baseline-root` to authenticate to the stage account and all other child accounts. There are many ways to

----

[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: On some operating systems, such as MacOS, you may also need to increase your open files limit to avoid "pipe: too many open files" errors by running: `ulimit -n 10240`.

Remember to repeat this process in the other child accounts too (i.e., dev, prod, shared, etc)!

=== Try authenticating as an IAM user to the child accounts

Now that you have IAM users in the security account and IAM roles in the other accounts, it's time to practice
authenticating:

. Use your IAM user's user name and password (decrypted using keybase) to log into the web console of the security
  account (remember to use the IAM user sign-in URL for the security account).
. Follow the steps in <<lock_down_iam_users>> to lock down your IAM user in the security account. This includes
  configuring an MFA device for your IAM user.
. After configuring an MFA device, log out, and then log back into the security account again, this time providing your
  MFA token. If you don't do this, attempting to assume IAM roles in other accounts won't work, as those roles require
  an MFA token to be present.
. Try to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-console.html[switch to a role] in
  one of the other child accounts using the AWS Web Console. For example, authenticate as one of the IAM users in the
  security account, and then assume the `allow-full-access-from-other-accounts` role in the dev account (you can find
  the default list of IAM roles created in each account
  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security/tree/master/modules/cross-account-iam-roles#resources-created[here]).
. Alternatively, you can use the `aws-vault login xxx` command to login to the AWS Web Console for any profile `xxx`
  that you've configured in `aws-vault`. For example, `aws-vault login logs-from-root` will open up your web browser
  and log you into the logs account using the `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` IAM Role.

== Next steps

Now that you have your basic AWS account structure set up, the next step is to start deploying infrastructure in those
accounts! Usually, the best starting point is to configure your network topology, as described in
link:/guides/networking/how-to-deploy-production-grade-vpc-aws[How to deploy a production-grade VPC on AWS].
