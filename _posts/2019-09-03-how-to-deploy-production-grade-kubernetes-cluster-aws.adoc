== Intro

This guide will walk you through the process of configuring a production-grade Kubernetes cluster on AWS.

=== What is Kubernetes?

https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes (K8S)] is an open-source system for managing containerized applications, including:

Scheduling::
  Deploy containers across a cluster of servers, using the available resources (data centers, servers, CPU, memory,
  ports, etc.) as efficiently as possible.

Deployments::
  Roll out updates to containers using a variety of deployment strategies, such as rolling deployment, blue-green
  deployment, and canary deployment, and automatically roll back if there's an error.

Auto healing::
  Monitor the health of your containers and servers and automatically replace unhealthy ones.

Auto scaling::
  Scale the number of containers and servers up or down in response to load.

Load balancing::
  Make your containers accessible to the outside world and distribute traffic across your containers.

Service discovery::
  Allow containers to find and communicate with each other over the network, automatically routing requests to the
  proper destination.

Configuration and secrets::
  Provide containers with environment-specific configuration data and secrets.

=== What you'll learn in this guide

=== Why Kubernetes

.The popularity of container orchestration tools
image::/assets/img/guides/eks/docker-orchestration-google-trends.png[]

Kubernetes has become the de facto choice for container orchestration. Here's why:

Massive feature set::
  Kubernetes offers a huge range of functionality for managing containers, including auto scaling, auto healing,
  rolling deployments, service discovery, secrets management, configuration management, bin packing, storage
  orchestration, batch execution, access controls, log aggregation, SSH access, batch processing, and much more.

Massive community::
  Kubernetes has the biggest community of any orchestration tool, with more than 50,000 stars and 2,500 contributors on
  https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes[GitHub], thousands of blog posts, numerous books, hundreds of meetup groups,
  several dedicated conferences, and a huge ecosystem of frameworks, tools, plugins, integrations, and service
  providers.

Run anywhere::
  You can run Kubernetes on-premise, in the cloud (with 1st class support from the cloud provider, e.g.,: AWS offers
  EKS, Google Cloud offers GKE, Azure offers AKS), and on your own computer (it's built directly into the Docker
  desktop app). This reduces lock-in and makes multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud more manageable, as both the containers
  themselves and the way you manage them are portable.

Proven technology::
  Kubernetes was originally designed by Google, based on years of experience with their internal container management
  systems (Borg and Omega), and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It's designed for massive
  scale and resiliency (Google runs billions of containers per week) and with a huge community behind it, it's
  continuously getting better.

=== Kubernetes architecture

Let's start by looking at Kubernetes from a very high level, and then gradually zoom in. When starting at this high
level, a simple way to think about Kubernetes is as an operating system for your data center.

.Kubernetes is like an operating system for your data center, abstracting away the underlying hardware behind its API
image::/assets/img/guides/eks/kubernetes-simple.png[]

Operating system for a single computer::
  On a single computer, the operating system (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS) abstracts away all the low-level hardware
  details so that as a developer, you can build apps against a high-level, consistent, safe API (the _Kernel API_),
  without having to worry too much about the differences between many types of hardware (i.e., the many types of CPU,
  RAM, hard drive, etc) or about managing any of the applications running on that hardware (i.e., the OS handles device
  drivers, time sharing, memory management, process isolation, etc).

Operating system for a data center::
  In a data center, an orchestration tool like Kubernetes also abstracts away all the hardware details, but it does it
  for multiple computers (multiple servers), so that as a developer, you can deploy your applications using a
  high-level, consistent, safe API (the _Kubernetes API_), without having to worry too much about the differences
  between the servers or about managing any of the applications running on those servers (i.e., the orchestration tool
  handles deploying applications, restarting them if they fail, allowing them to communicate over the network, etc.).

To use the Kernel API, your application makes system calls. To use the Kubernetes API, you make HTTPS calls, typically
by using the official command-line utility for Kubernetes,
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/[kubectl]. When working with the Kubernetes API, you express
_what_ you want to deploy—i.e., which Docker containers, how many of them, what CPU, memory, and ports they need,
etc—in a YAML file, use `kubectl` to send that YAML file to Kubernetes via an API call, and Kubernetes will
figure out _how_ to make that happen, including picking the best servers to handle the requirements in your YAML file,
deploying the containers on those servers, monitoring and restarting the containers if they crash, scaling the number
of containers up and down with load, and so on.

If you zoom in a bit further on the Kubernetes architecture, it looks something like this:

.Kubernetes architecture
image::/assets/img/guides/eks/kubernetes-architecture.png[]

Kubernetes consists of two main pieces: the control plane and worker nodes. Each of these will be discussed next.

==== Control plane

The _https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/#kubernetes-control-plane[control plane]_ is responsible for managing the
entire cluster. It consists of one or more master nodes (typically 3 master nodes for high availability), where each
master node runs several components:

Kubernetes API Server::
  The _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/[Kubernetes API Server]_ is the
  endpoint you're talking to when you use the Kubernetes API (e.g., via `kubectl`).

Scheduler::
  The _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-scheduler/[scheduler]_ is responsible for
  figuring out which of the worker nodes to use to run your container(s). It tries to pick the "best" worker node based
  on a number of factors, such as high availability (try to run copies of the same container on different nodes so a
  failure in one node doesn't take them all down), resource utilization (try to run the container on the least utilized
  node), container requirements (try to find nodes that meet the container's requirements in terms of CPU, memory, port
  numbers, etc), and so on.

Controller Manager::
  The _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/[controller manager]_
  runs all the _controllers_, each of which is a control loop that continuously watches the state of the cluster and
  makes changes to move the cluster towards the desired state (you define the desired state via API calls). For
  example, the _node controller_ watches worker nodes and tries to ensure the requested number of Nodes is always
  running and the _replication controller_ watches containers and tries to ensure the requested number of containers is
  always running.

etcd::
  _https://etcd.io[etcd]_ is a distributed key-value store that the master nodes use as a persistent way to store the
  cluster configuration.

==== Worker nodes

The _https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/[worker nodes]_ (or just _nodes_, for short) are the
servers that run your containers. Each worker node runs several components:

Kubelet::
  The _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/[kubelet]_ is the primary agent that
  you run on each worker node. It is responsible for talking to the Kubernetes API Server, figuring out the containers
  that are supposed to be on its worker node, and deploying those containers, monitoring them, and restarting any
  containers that are unhealthy.

kube-proxy::
  The _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/[Kubernetes Service Proxy (kube-proxy)]_
  also runs on each worker node. It is responsible for talking to the Kubernetes API Server, figuring out which
  containers live at which IPs, and proxying requests from containers on the same worker node to those IPs. This is
  used for Service Discovery within Kubernetes, a topic we'll discuss later.

=== Kubernetes access control

To access your Kubernetes cluster, you have to understand Kubernetes authentication and authorization.

==== Kubernetes authentication

Kubernetes uses authentication plugins to authenticate API requests. Depending on the plugins you're using, there are
a number of supported
_https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#authentication-strategies[authentication strategies]_,
including X509 client certs, static token files, bootstrap tokens, static password files, service account tokens,
OpenID connect tokens, and more.

When you authenticate, you authenticate as one of two types of accounts:

User accounts::
  _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/#user-accounts-vs-service-accounts[User accounts]_
  are used by humans or other services outside of the Kubernetes cluster. For example, an admin at your
  company may distribute X509 certificates to your team members, or if you're using a Kubernetes service managed by AWS (i.e, EKS), the user accounts may be the IAM user accounts you have in AWS.

Service accounts::
  _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/[Service accounts]_ are managed and
  used by resources within the Kubernetes cluster itself, such as your pods.
  Kubernetes creates some service accounts automatically; you can create others using the Kubernetes API. The
  credentials for service accounts are stored as secrets in Kubernetes and mounted into the pods that should have
  access to those service accounts.

==== Kubernetes authorization

Once you've authenticated and the Kubernetes API Server knows _who_ you are, depending on the plugins you're using,
it will use one of several supported
_https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/#authorization-modules[authorization modes]_ to
determine _what_ you can do. The standard authorization mode is
_https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/[role-based access control (RBAC)]_, where you create
roles with access to specific Kubernetes APIs (e.g., the ability to call `GET` on the secrets API in a specific
namespace), and associate those roles with the specific user and service accounts that should have those permissions.

=== Interacting with Kubernetes

Once you have a Kubernetes cluster up and running, there are a number of ways to interact with it. This section will
go through a few of the most common ones, including the API, `kubectl`, the Web UI, and Terraform.

==== API

Under the hood, any Kubernetes tool you use will be talking to the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-overview/[Kubernetes API]. However, it's relatively rare for you to
have to make API calls directly (if you do have to, see the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/#api-client-libraries[API client libraries]), so let's quickly move on to the
other tools that build on top of the API.

==== kubectl

https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/[kubectl] is the official command-line interface (CLI) for
working with Kubernetes. For example, to deploy the https://hub.docker.com/r/training/webapp[training/webapp] Docker
container (a simple "Hello, World" webapp) and have it listen on port 5000, you could run:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl run webapp \
  --image=training/webapp:latest \
  --port 5000 \
  --generator=run-pod/v1
----

And to see the pods running in your cluster, you could run:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods
----

To be able to authenticate to different EKS clusters or as different users, you can create one or more `kubectl`
configuration files, which are typically called _kubeconfig files_ (note, the files do not actually need to be called
`kubeconfig`). In a kubeconfig file, you can define one or more _contexts_, where each context specifies a cluster to
connect to and a user to use for authentication. You can then use the `kubectl config use-context` command to quickly
switch between contexts—and therefore, different clusters and users.

==== Web UI (Dashboard)

.The Kubernetes Dashboard
image::/assets/img/guides/eks/kubernetes-dashboard.png[]

The _https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/[Kubernetes Dashboard]_ is a
web-based interface you can use to manage your Kubernetes cluster. The dashboard is not enabled by default in most
Kubernetes distributions. Check out
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/#deploying-the-dashboard-ui[Deploying the Dashboard UI]
and
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/#accessing-the-dashboard-ui[Accessing the Dashboard UI]
for instructions.

==== Terraform

Terraform has a https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/kubernetes/index.html[Kubernetes provider] that allows you to
write Terraform code that, under the hood, calls the Kubernetes API. This allows you to manage all your
infrastructure—including your VPCs, databases, Kubernetes clusters, and Kubernetes services—using the same language and
workflow. The downside is that the Terraform Kubernetes provider seems to lag behind considerably, and is missing
some of the features you need for effectively working with Kubernetes, which often requires you to go outside of
Terraform code anyway (e.g., execute a script).

=== Kubernetes resources

Using one of the previously mentioned tools, you can create one or more _resources_ within your Kubernetes cluster,
such as pods, controllers, namespaces, services, and configuration.

==== Pods

With Kubernetes, you don't run containers directly. Instead, the basic building block in Kubernetes is a
_https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/[pod]_, which is a group of one or more related containers that
are always deployed together. For example, you could have a pod with just a single container, such as a container that
runs a Node.js app, or a pod with several related containers, such as one container that runs a Node.js app, another
container that runs a logs and metrics agent for the Node.js app, and a third container that runs nginx as a reverse
proxy for the Node.js app.

Here are the key ideas to keep in mind when thinking about pods:

How pods are deployed::
  Whenever you tell Kubernetes to deploy a pod (e.g., using `kubectl`, which we'll discuss below), the scheduler will
  pick a worker node for that pod, and the kubelet on that worker node will deploy all the containers for that pod
  together.

A pod is like a logical machine::
  All the containers in a pod run in the same Linux namespace and can talk to each other over localhost (note: this
  implies the containers in a pod must all listen on different ports), so it can be helpful to think of each pod as a
  _logical machine_, with its own IP address and processes that are separate from all other pods.

Sidecars::
  Pods offer a nice format for combining and composing multiple processes together, even if the processes are built
  with totally different technologies, as each process can be encapsulated in its own container. For example, a common
  pattern is to define pods with one main container (e.g., a web service you wrote with Node.js/Javascript) and one or
  more _sidecars_: that is, containers that provide supporting functionality, such as a proxy sidecar (e.g., Envoy
  proxy, which is written in Go) and a log aggregation sidecar (e.g., Fluentd, which is written in Ruby).

Pods are ephemeral::
  Pods (and for that matter, containers) are relatively _ephemeral_: that is, they can be shut down and replaced at any
  time. This might happen because a node crashes or because you're deploying a new version of the pod or a number of
  other reasons. This is a critical idea to keep in mind as you design your system, especially when thinking about
  fault tolerance, replication, and state.

==== Controllers

Pods are the basic building blocks of Kubernetes, but you typically don't deploy them directly either. A single pod on
a single worker node is a single point of failure: the kubelet on that node can restart the pod if it crashes, but
if the entire node crashes, or if you want to run multiple pods for high availability and scalability, you need a
higher level construct. This is where controllers come in. Controllers allow you to manage multiple pods across
multiple nodes.

The most common controller you're likely to use is the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/[Deployment], which allows you to specify:

* What pod to deploy.
* How many _replicas_ (copies) of that pod you want running.
* How to roll out updates to the replicas whenever you make a change.

The Deployment will deploy your replicas, constantly monitor them, and automatically replace any replicas that fail.
When you apply a change to your Deployment—e.g., change the Docker image tag—the Deployment will automatically roll
that change out using one of several built-in strategies, such as rolling deployment and canary deployment.

==== Namespaces

_https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/[Namespaces]_ allow you to logically
partition your Kubernetes cluster into multiple virtual clusters. Every command you issue to the Kubernetes API Server
(e.g., via `kubectl`) and almost every resource you create in Kubernetes (e.g., every pod) runs within a namespace; if
you don't specify a namespace, the `default` namespace is used. By granting users access only to specific namespaces
and by configuring your cluster to only allow connectivity between resources in the same namespace, you can use
namespaces as a lightweight way to group applications and provide some isolation between them.

==== Services and Service Discovery

Every pod in Kubernetes gets an IP address, but this IP could change every time the pod is redeployed. Moreover, you
typically don't want the IP of a single pod, but some way to talk to all the related pods that make up a logical
service: e.g., if you have 3 replicas of your Node.js pod, what you really want is some way to have requests
load balanced across all of these pods, even as the IPs of the individual pods or the number of pods changes.

To do this, you can create a Kubernetes _https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/[service]_,
which can provide a single endpoint in front of a set of pods, and automatically load balance and route traffic to the
right destinations, even as the underlying pods change and move around. Your apps can then discover other services
(_service discovery_) by getting the endpoint IP from an environment variable and/or via DNS (the latter is typically
provided by a Kubernetes cluster add-on). For example, if your Node.js pods need to talk to some pods running a Java
backend, you could configure a service called `backend` in front of the Java pods, and the Node.js apps will be able to
talk to the backend by sending requests to `backend.<NAMESPACE>.svc.cluster.local`, where `<NAMESPACE>` is the name of
your Kubernetes namespace.

// TODO: Commented out for now. This probably belongs in a separate guide on how to deploy services on top of
// Kubernetes. That guide can talk about Helm, load balancing, etc.
//
//=== LoadBalancer and ingress
//
//Depending on the networking plugin you use with Kubernetes, your pods are most likely accessible to other pods within
//the Kubernetes cluster, but they are not accessible to the outside world. If you need to expose your pods to the public
//Internet (e.g., for a user-facing service), the two most common ways to do it in Kubernetes are:
//
//LoadBalancer::
//  When defining a service in Kubernetes, you can set the type to
//  _https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/#loadbalancer[LoadBalancer]_, and Kubernetes will spin up
//  a load balancer that listens on a specified port and distributes all traffic on that port across your pods.
//+
//[source,yaml]
//----
//apiVersion: v1
//kind: Service
//metadata:
//  name: example
//spec:
//  # Route all traffic on port 80 to port 8080 of the example app
//  type: LoadBalancer
//  ports:
//  - port: 80
//    targetPort: 8080
//  selector:
//    app: example
//----
//+
//Under the hood, this is implemented using different add-ons in different types of Kubernetes clusters: EKS can use either a
//https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/introduction.html[Classic Load Balancer] or
//https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html[Network Load Balancer] (see
//https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/load-balancing.html[EKS Load Balancing] for details). The advantage
//of using a LoadBalancer is that it works with all traffic, regardless of protocol (e.g., HTTP, TCP, UDP, etc); the
//disadvantage is that it offers no other configuration (e.g., no filtering or routing) and spins up a separate load
//balancer with a separate IP or domain name for every service (which can be pricey and harder to manage).
//
//Ingress controller::
//  Another way to expose your pods is to create a standalone resource called an
//  _https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress[ingress]_:
//+
//[source,yaml]
//----
//apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
//kind: Ingress
//metadata:
//  name: example
//spec:
//  rules:
//  - http:
//      paths:
//      # Route the /example URL to the example service on port 80
//      - path: /example
//        backend:
//          serviceName: example
//          servicePort: 80
//----
//+
//Under the hood, ingress controllers are also implemented using different add-ons in different types of Kubernetes
//clusters: in AWS, you can use
//https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller[aws-alb-ingress-controller] to spin up an
//https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html[Application Load Balancer (ALB)].
//The advantage of an ingress controller is that you can share one load balancer across many services and take advantage
//of higher-level features, such as path-based routing and SSL termination.

==== Configuration and secrets

To allow you to use the same container in different environments with different settings (e.g., dev, stage, prod), you
can use a _https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/[ConfigMap]_, which is a
map of key/value pairs where the values can be strings or even entire files.  Kubernetes stores ConfigMaps in etcd and
can expose specific key/value pairs or the contents of the entire ConfigMap to your containers as either
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#define-container-environment-variables-using-configmap-data[environment variables]
or
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#add-configmap-data-to-a-volume[files mounted in a volume].

If you need to pass sensitive information to your containers (e.g., credentials or API keys), you can instead use a
_https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Kubernetes Secret]_. Secrets work more or less the same
way as ConfigMaps—i.e., they contain key/value pairs and can be exposed to containers as environment variables or
files—with the main difference being that:

* When exposing a secret to your containers, Kubernetes ensures the secret is only ever stored in memory. If you're
  exposing the secret as a file mounted in a volume, Kubernetes will use a volume backed by
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#secret[tmpfs, a RAM-backed filesystem], to ensure the secret is
  never written to disk.
* Kubernetes stores Secrets in an encrypted form in etcd.
+
NOTE: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/[etcd encryption] is only available as of
Kubernetes 1.13 and not available out of the box on all Kubernetes platforms (older versions of Kubernetes stored
secrets unencrypted!).

=== Options for running Kubernetes in AWS

There are a number of different options for running Kubernetes in AWS:

Deploy it yourself::
  You could try to follow the https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/[Kubernetes documentation] and
  https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way[Kubernetes the hard way] to create a Kubernetes cluster
  from scratch on top of EC2 instances. This gives you full control over every aspect of your Kubernetes cluster, but
  it is a considerable amount of work (3-6 months to get something production-grade, minimum) and puts the full burden
  of maintenance, scalability, high availability, disaster recovery, and updates on you.

Kubernetes deployment tools::
  There are a number of Kubernetes tools that can automatically spin up a cluster for you, including
  https://eksctl.io[eksctl] (the official tool from AWS), https://github.com/kubernetes/kops[kops],
  https://kubespray.io/[kubespray], and https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm[kubeadm]. These tools allow you to get a
  reasonable cluster up and running in a few commands, significantly reducing the amount of work compared to doing it
  from scratch. However, it's typically hard to customize and manage those clusters, as you don't have the
  infrastructure defined as code (note: `kops` can generate Terraform code, but it's probably not the way you'd write
  the code yourself and if you modify that code, it's not clear if you can still use `kops`), and most importantly,
  these tools put the full burden of maintenance, scalability, high availability, disaster recovery, and updates on
  you (except `eksctl`, which spins up an EKS cluster).

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service::
  https://aws.amazon.com/eks/[Amazon EKS] is a managed service in AWS for using Kubernetes. It runs the entire control
  plane for you, with first-class integration with other AWS services (e.g., VPCs, IAM, etc). That means you can get
  EKS running quickly, manage everything as code, and benefit from AWS handling all the maintenance, scalability,
  high availability, disaster recovery, and updates of the control plane for you. The main drawbacks is that EKS is
  still fairly new, so some functionality is missing or more complicated to use than it should be.

[[production_grade_design]]
== Production-grade design

With all the core concepts out of the way, let's now discuss how to configure a production-grade Kubernetes cluster
that looks something like this:

.Production-grade EKS architecture
image::/assets/img/guides/eks/eks-architecture.png[]

=== Use EKS

We recommend using https://aws.amazon.com/eks/[Amazon EKS] to run Kubernetes in AWS. It manages the control plane
for you, which significantly reduces your operational burden; it has good integration with other AWS services; you can
manage it entirely as code; and while EKS still has some gaps in terms of features, and is more complicated to use than
it should be, AWS seems to be heavily investing into the service, so any small benefits you get from using other
solutions will most likely be eclipsed very quickly by future EKS releases.

=== VPC configuration

EKS relies on a _https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/[Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)]_ to provide the basic network topology and
to manage communication across the nodes (see
link:/guides/networking/how-to-deploy-production-grade-vpc-aws[How to deploy a production-grade VPC on AWS] for more
information on VPCs). Here are the key VPC considerations for your EKS cluster:

Add tags to the VPC and subnets::
  EKS relies on special tags on the VPC and subnets to know which VPC resources to use for deploying
  infrastructure. For example, EKS uses tags to figure out which subnets to use for the load balancers associated with a
  Service resource. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network_reqs.html[Cluster VPC Considerations]
  for more information.

Configure DNS forwarding::
  EKS supports private API endpoints so that the Kubernetes API Server can only be accessed within the VPC. The
  hostname for this internal endpoint lives in a
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-private.html[Route 53 private hosted zone],
  which works fine if you're trying to access it from within the VPC, but does not work (by default) if you try to
  access it over a VPC peering connection. For example, if you had Kubernetes in an application VPC, and DevOps tooling
  (e.g., and OpenVPN server or a Jenkins server) in a peered management VPC, by default, that management tooling would
  not be able to talk to this private endpoint. To fix this issue, configure DNS forwarding by creating a
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver-getting-started.html[Route 53 Resolver] and make
  sure that remote VPC DNS resolution is enabled on both accepter and requester side of the connection peering.

=== Control plane

To have EKS manage the control plane for you, you need to create an
_https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/clusters.html[EKS cluster]_. When you create an EKS cluster, behind
the scenes, AWS fires up several master nodes in a highly available configuration, complete with the Kubernetes API
Server, scheduler, controller manager, and etcd. Here are the key considerations for your EKS cluster:

Kubernetes version::
  When creating your EKS cluster, you can pick which version of Kubernetes to use. For each version of Kubernetes,
  EKS may have one or more _https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/platform-versions.html[platform versions]_
  that are compatible with it. For example, Kubernetes 1.12.6 had platform versions `eks.1` and `eks.2`. AWS
  automatically updates the control plane to use the latest platform version compatible with your chosen Kubernetes
  minor version.

Subnets::
  Your EKS cluster will run in the subnets you specify. We strongly recommend running solely in private subnets that
  are NOT directly accessible from the public Internet. See
  link:/guides/networking/how-to-deploy-production-grade-vpc-aws[How to deploy a production-grade VPC on AWS] for more
  info.

Endpoint access::
  You can configure whether the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-endpoint.html[API endpoint for your EKS cluster]
  is accessible from (a) within the same VPC and/or (b) from the public Internet. We recommend allowing access from
  within the VPC, but not from the public Internet. If you need to talk to your Kubernetes cluster from your own
  computer (e.g., to issue commands via `kubectl`), use a bastion host or VPN server. See
  link:/guides/networking/how-to-deploy-production-grade-vpc-aws[How to deploy a production-grade VPC on AWS] for more
  info.

Cluster IAM Role::
  To be able to make API calls to other AWS services,
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/service_IAM_role.html[your EKS cluster must have an IAM role] with
  the following managed IAM policies: `AmazonEKSServicePolicy` and `AmazonEKSClusterPolicy`.

Security group::
  You should define a security group that controls what traffic can go in and out of the control plane. The worker
  nodes must be able to talk to the control plane and vice versa: see
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/sec-group-reqs.html[Cluster Security Group Considerations] for the
  ports you should open up between them.

Logging::
  We recommend enabling https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html[control plane logging]
  so that the logs from the Kubernetes API server, controller manager, scheduler, and other components are sent to
  CloudWatch.

=== Worker nodes

While EKS will run the control plane for you, it's up to you to create the worker nodes. Here are the key
considerations:

Auto Scaling Group::
  We recommend using an https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html[Auto Scaling Group]
  to run your worker nodes. This way, failed nodes will be automatically replaced, and you can use auto scaling
  policies to automatically scale the number of nodes up and down in response to load.

Tags::
  EKS requires that all worker node EC2 instances have a tag with the key `kubernetes.io/cluster/<CLUSTER_NAME>` and
  value `owned`.

Subnets::
  We strongly recommend running the Auto Scaling Group for your worker nodes in private subnets that are NOT directly
  accessible from the public Internet. See
  link:/guides/networking/how-to-deploy-production-grade-vpc-aws[How to deploy a production-grade VPC on AWS] for more
  info.

AMI::
  Each worker node will need Docker, kubelet,
  https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator[AWS IAM Authenticator], and a
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-workers.html[bootstrap script] installed. We recommend
  using the
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-optimized-ami.html[Amazon EKS-Optimized AMI] or one of the
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-partner-amis.html[EKS partner AMIs] (e.g., there is an Ubuntu
  AMI), as these already have all the necessary software installed.

User Data::
  Each worker node must register itself to the Kubernetes API. This can be done using a
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-workers.html[bootstrap script] that is bundled with the EKS
  optimized AMI. We recommend running this bootstrap script as part of
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html[User Data] so that it executes when the EC2
  instance is booting.

IAM role::
  In order for the kubelet on each worker node to be able to make API calls, each
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/worker_node_IAM_role.html[worker node must have an IAM role] with
  the following managed IAM policies: `AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy`, `AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy`,
  `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly`.

Security group::
  You should define a security group that controls what traffic can go in and out of each worker node. The worker
  nodes must be able to talk to the control plane and vice versa: see
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/sec-group-reqs.html[Cluster Security Group Considerations] for the
  ports you should open up between them.

Server hardening::
  There are a number of server-hardening techniques that you should apply to each worker node. This includes
  a secure base image (e.g., CIS hardened images), intrusion prevention (e.g., `fail2ban`), file integrity monitoring
  (e.g., Tripwire), anti-virus (e.g., Sophos), automatically installing critical security updates (e.g.,
  `unattended-upgrades` for Ubuntu), locking down EC2 metadata (e.g., `ip-lockdown`), and so on.

=== Authenticate

EKS manages authentication via AWS IAM, which is not an authentication method natively supported by most Kubernetes
tooling, including `kubectl`. Therefore, before using `kubectl`, you have to use one of the following utilities to
authenticate:

https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[AWS CLI]::
  AWS now has first-class support for authenticating to EKS built directly into the `aws` CLI (minimum version:
  `1.16.232`). See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html[Installing the AWS CLI] for
  setup instructions. To use it, you fist run the `update-kubeconfig` command:
+
[source,bash]
----
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <AWS_REGION> --name <EKS_CLUSTER_NAME>
----
+
This will update your kubeconfig so that `kubectl` will automatically call `aws eks get-token` for authentication; the
`aws eks get-token` command will, in turn, use the standard
https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-authenticating-to-aws-on-the-command-line-63656a686799[AWS CLI mechanisms to authenticate to AWS]:
i.e., the credentials file at `~/.aws/credentials`, environment variables, etc.

https://eksctl.io[eksctl]::
  `eksctl` is the official CLI tool for EKS. It's primary purpose is to deploy and manage the EKS cluster itself, but
  you can also use it to authenticate to a cluster. To install `eksctl`, check out
  https://eksctl.io/introduction/installation/[these instructions]. To authenticate with `eksctl`, you run the
  `eksctl utils write-kubeconfig` command:
+
[source,bash]
----
eksctl utils write-kubeconfig --region <AWS_REGION> --name=<EKS_CLUSTER_NAME>
----
+
This will update your kubeconfig so that `kubectl` will automatically call either the AWS CLI or AWS IAM Authenticator
for authentication.

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt[kubergrunt]::
  A CLI tool maintained by Gruntwork that supports authentication to EKS, as well as several other important utilities,
  such as tools for doing zero-downtime rolling deployments of EKS worker nodes and managing TLS certificates in
  Kubernetes. The easiest way to install it is to use one of the pre-built binaries from the
  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/releases[kubergrunt releases] page. To authenticate with `kubergrunt`, you
  run `kubergrunt eks configure`:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubergrunt eks configure --eks-cluster-arn <EKS_CLUSTER_ARN>
----
+
This will update your kubeconfig to use `kubergrunt eks token` for authentication.

https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator[AWS IAM Authenticator for Kubernetes]::
  A CLI tool maintained by the Heptio and Amazon EKS teams. This was the main tool AWS recommended for authenticating
  to EKS until first-class support was added directly to the AWS CLI. At this point, there is no reason to install
  this tool separately, so we are just recording this here for historical reasons.

=== IAM role mapping and RBAC

You've seen that to determine _who_ the user is (authentication), EKS uses IAM. The next step is to determine _what_
the user can do (authorization). Kubernetes uses its own roles and RBAC for authorization, so the question is, how does
EKS know which IAM entities (that is, IAM users or roles) are associated with which Kubernetes roles?

The answer is that EKS expects you to define a ConfigMap called `aws-auth` that defines the mapping from IAM entities
to Kubernetes roles. When you first provision an EKS cluster, the IAM user or role that you used to authenticate is
automatically granted admin level permissions (the `system:master` role). You can use this role to add additional role
mappings in the `aws-auth` ConfigMap.

Here's an example `aws-auth` ConfigMap:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: aws-auth
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  mapRoles: |
    - rolearn: arn:aws:iam::11122223333:role/example-role
      username: system:node:{{EC2PrivateDNSName}}
      groups:
        - system:bootstrappers
        - system:nodes
  mapUsers: |
    - userarn: arn:aws:iam::11122223333:user/example-user
      username: example-user
      groups:
        - system:masters
----

This ConfigMap tells EKS that anyone who authenticates as the IAM role called `example-role` should automatically get
the permissions in the `system:bootstrappers` and `system:nodes` Kubernetes roles, and anyone who authenticates with as
the IAM user `example-user` should automatically get the permissions in the `system:masters` Kubernetes role. Note that
when users authenticate using an IAM role or IAM user, they are mapped to a Kubernetes user with the `username` you
specify in the `aws-auth` ConfigMap (i.e., that's the username that will show up in the Kubernetes audit log).

Note that, as of September, 2019, the `aws-auth` ConfigMap supports mapping IAM roles and IAM users, but not IAM groups
(see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html[Managing Users or IAM Roles for your EKS Cluster]).
Mapping every individual user in your organization is most likely difficult to manage, so we instead recommend creating
IAM roles, mapping those IAM roles to Kubernetes roles in `aws-auth`, and allowing IAM users in specific IAM groups to
assume those roles.

// TODO: Commented out for now. This probably belongs in a separate guide on how to deploy services on top of
// Kubernetes. That guide can talk about Helm, load balancing, etc.
//
//=== LoadBalancer and ingress
//
//EKS has https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/load-balancing.html[built-in support for the LoadBalancer]
//service type. It uses the Classic Load Balancer by default; if you wish to use the Network Load Balancer instead, you
//need to add the following annotation to your service:
//
//[source,yaml]
//----
//service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: nlb
//----
//
//For most HTTP/HTTPS use cases, you'll instead want to use an ingress controller, to take advantage of SSL termination
//and path-based routing. To support this, you will need to install and configure the
//https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller[aws-alb-ingress-controller].
//
//=== External DNS
//
//If you're using the ingress controller, then Kubernetes will automatically spin up an ALB for you in AWS. How, then, do
//you configure DNS settings for that ALB? Normally, we recommend using Terraform to configure DNS entries (e.g., using
//the https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/route53_record.html[aws_route53_record resource]), but what do you do
//when the ALB is deployed (asynchronously) by Kubernetes?
//
//We recommend solving this by using the https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-dns[external-dns]
//add-on, which will:
//
//. Automatically find hostnames you've defined in your ingress configurations.
//. Wait for the ingress controller to finish deploying (e.g., wait for the ALB to deploy).
//. Create DNS entries for those hostnames in your chose DNS provider
//
//Note that external-dns only works with certain DNS providers (e.g., Route 53, Google Cloud DNS, CloudFlare—see the
//https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-dns#the-latest-release-v05[full list here]), and it will only add
//DNS entries to existing domains; it's up to you to register the domains (e.g., in Route 53, GoDaddy, etc) as you
//normally do.

=== Logging

We recommend enabling the following logging to help with debugging and troubleshooting:

Control plane logging::
  We recommend enabling https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html[control plane logging]
  in EKS, at least for the API server logs, audit logs, and authenticator logs, as these are critical for debugging and
  auditing. You may wish to enable controller manager and scheduler logs too.

Worker node logging::
  We recommend installing https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/incubator/fluentd-cloudwatch[fluentd-cloudwatch]
  in the EKS cluster. This will run https://www.fluentd.org/[fluentd] on each worker node and configure it to send all
  the logs from the worker nodes (including all the pods on them) to CloudWatch.

=== Protecting pods

There are several policies you may want to enable to protect the pods in your cluster:

PodSecurityPolicy::
  You can use a _https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/[PodSecurityPolicy]_ to define what
  security-related features users can or can’t use in their pods. For example, you can specify if pods can run
  `privileged` containers, which ports a container can bind to, which kernel capabilities can be added to a container,
  what user IDs a container can run as, and so on. Follow the
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege[principle of least privilege] and provide pods with as few
  permissions as possible. You can also use RBAC to assign a different PodSecurityPolicy to different users or roles
  (e.g., give admins a less restrictive PodSecurityPolicy than other users).

NetworkPolicy::
  You can use a _https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/[NetworkPolicy]_ to define
  the inbound and outbound networking rules for your pods. We recommend adding a default NetworkPolicy that denies all
  inbound and outbound traffic (again, principle of least privilege) and then adding a NetworkPolicy for each pod that
  gives it permissions to talk solely to the other pods it should be able to access.
+
NOTE: `NetworkPolicy` is not supported out of the box by EKS unless you use a custom networking engine such as
https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.9/introduction/[calico] or https://istio.io[istio].

[[deployment_walkthrough]]
== Deployment walkthrough

// TODO: do we have existing code with a sane PodSecurityPolicy and NetworkPolicy?
// Answer: we have not yet added a module for PodSecurityPolicy (EKS only added support for it recently) and EKS does
// not natively support NetworkPolicy

Let's now walk through how to deploy a production-grade Kubernetes cluster in AWS, fully defined and managed as code,
using the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library.

[[pre_requisites]]
=== Pre-requisites

This walkthrough has the following pre-requisites:

Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library::
  This guide uses code from the https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library], as it
  implements most of the production-grade design for you out of the box. Make sure to read
  link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library[How to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library].
+
[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: You must be a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscriber# to access the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library.

Terraform::
  This guide uses https://www.terraform.io/[Terraform] to define and manage all the infrastructure as code. If you're
  not familiar with Terraform, check out https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-terraform-b3d32832baca[A
  Comprehensive Guide to Terraform], https://training.gruntwork.io/p/terraform[A Crash Course on Terraform], and
  link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library[How to Use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library].

Python and Kubergrunt::
  Some of the Terraform modules used in this guide call out to Python code and/or
  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt[kubergrunt] to fill in missing features in Terraform. Make sure you have
  Python and `kubergrunt` installed on any computer where you will be running Terraform.

Docker and Packer::
  This guide assumes you are deploying a Kubernetes cluster for use with https://www.docker.com[Docker]. The guide also
  uses https://www.packer.io[Packer] to build VM images. If you're not familiar with Docker or Packer, check out
  https://training.gruntwork.io/p/a-crash-course-on-docker-packer[A Crash Course on Docker and Packer] and
  link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library[How to Use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library].

AWS accounts::
  This guide deploys infrastructure into one or more AWS accounts. Check out the
  link:/guides/foundations/how-to-configure-production-grade-aws-account-structure[How to configure a production-grade AWS account structure]
  guide for instructions. You will also need to be able to authenticate to these accounts on the CLI: check out
  https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-authenticating-to-aws-on-the-command-line-63656a686799[A Comprehensive Guide to Authenticating to AWS on the Command Line]
  for instructions.

=== Deploy the VPC

The first step is to deploy a VPC. Follow the instructions in
link:/guides/networking/how-to-deploy-production-grade-vpc-aws[How to deploy a production-grade VPC on AWS] to use
`module-vpc` to create a VPC setup that looks like this:

.A production-grade VPC setup deployed using module-vpc from the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library
image::/assets/img/guides/vpc/vpc-diagram.png[]

After following this guide, you should have `vpc-app` wrapper module in your `infrastructure-modules` repo:

----
infrastructure-modules
  └ networking
    └ vpc-mgmt
    └ vpc-app
      └ main.tf
      └ outputs.tf
      └ variables.tf
----

Here's a snippet of what the code in the `vpc-app` wrapper module looks like:

.infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc-app/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
module "vpc" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest module-vpc release
  source = "git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-vpc.git//modules/vpc-app?ref=<VERSION>"

  vpc_name         = var.vpc_name
  aws_region       = var.aws_region
  cidr_block       = var.cidr_block
  num_nat_gateways = var.num_nat_gateways
}

# ... (the rest of the code is omitted) ...
----

Update this module to use the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/tree/master/modules/eks-vpc-tags[eks-vpc-tags] module from the
`terraform-aws-eks` repo to add the tags required by EKS:

[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: You must be a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscriber# to access `terraform-aws-eks`.

.infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc-app/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
module "vpc" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest module-vpc release
  source = "git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-vpc.git//modules/vpc-app?ref=<VERSION>"

  vpc_name         = var.vpc_name
  aws_region       = var.aws_region
  cidr_block       = var.cidr_block
  num_nat_gateways = var.num_nat_gateways

  custom_tags                            = module.vpc_tags.vpc_eks_tags
  public_subnet_custom_tags              = module.vpc_tags.vpc_public_subnet_eks_tags
  private_app_subnet_custom_tags         = module.vpc_tags.vpc_private_app_subnet_eks_tags
  private_persistence_subnet_custom_tags = module.vpc_tags.vpc_private_persistence_subnet_eks_tags
}

module "vpc_tags" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest terraform-aws-eks release
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks.git//modules/eks-vpc-tags?ref=<VERSION>"

  eks_cluster_name = var.eks_cluster_name
}

# ... (the rest of the code is omitted) ...
----

Add a new input variable that you can use to specify the name of the EKS cluster:

.infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc-app/variables.tf
[source,hcl]
----
variable "eks_cluster_name" {
  description = "The EKS cluster that will be deployed into the VPC."
  type        = string
}
----

Next, configure DNS forwarding rules using the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-vpc/tree/master/modules/vpc-dns-forwarder[vpc-dns-forwarder] module in
`module-vpc`:

[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: You must be a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscriber# to access `module-vpc`.

.infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc-app/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
module "dns_mgmt_to_app" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest module-vpc release
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-vpc.git//modules/vpc-dns-forwarder?ref=<VERSION>"

  origin_vpc_id                                   = data.terraform_remote_state.mgmt_vpc.outputs.vpc_id
  origin_vpc_name                                 = data.terraform_remote_state.mgmt_vpc.outputs.vpc_name
  origin_vpc_route53_resolver_primary_subnet_id   = element(data.terraform_remote_state.mgmt_vpc.outputs.public_subnet_ids, 0)
  origin_vpc_route53_resolver_secondary_subnet_id = element(data.terraform_remote_state.mgmt_vpc.outputs.public_subnet_ids, 1)

  destination_vpc_id                                   = module.vpc.vpc_id
  destination_vpc_name                                 = module.vpc.vpc_name
  destination_vpc_route53_resolver_primary_subnet_id   = element(module.vpc.public_subnet_ids, 0)
  destination_vpc_route53_resolver_secondary_subnet_id = element(module.vpc.public_subnet_ids, 1)
}
----

At this point, you'll want to test your code. See
link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library#manual_tests_terraform[Manual tests for Terraform code]
and
link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library#automated_tests_terraform[Automated tests for Terraform code]
for instructions.

Once your updated `vpc-app` wrapper module is working the way you want, submit a pull request, get your changes merged
into the `master` branch, and create a new versioned release by using a Git tag. For example, to create a `v0.5.0`
release:

[source,bash]
----
git tag -a "v0.5.0" -m "Added tagging and DNS forwarding for EKS"
git push --follow-tags
----

NOTE: This guide will use https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt[Terragrunt] and its associated file and folder
structure to deploy Terraform modules. Please note that *Terragrunt is NOT required for using Terraform modules from
the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library.* Check out
link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library[How to Use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library] for instructions
on alternative options, such as how to
link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library#deploy_using_plain_terraform[Deploy using plain Terraform].

Head over to your `infrastructure-live` repo and update the `terragrunt.hcl` file to deploy this new version:

.infrastructure-live/production/us-east-2/stage/networking/vpc-app/terragrunt.hcl
[source,hcl]
----
terraform {
  source = "git@github.com/<YOUR_ORG>/infrastructure-modules.git//networking/vpc-app?ref=v0.5.0"
}
----

And run `terragrunt apply` to deploy the changes:

[source,bash]
----
cd infrastructure-live/production/us-east-2/stage/networking/vpc-app
terragrunt apply
----

=== Configure the control plane

Now that you have the VPC ready, it's time to configure the EKS control plane using the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/tree/master/modules/eks-cluster-control-plane[eks-cluster-control-plane module]
in `terraform-aws-eks`. Create a new module called `eks-cluster` in `infrastructure-modules:

----
infrastructure-modules
  └ networking
    └ vpc-mgmt
    └ vpc-app
  └ services
    └ eks-cluster
      └ main.tf
      └ dependencies.tf
      └ outputs.tf
      └ variables.tf
----

Inside of `main.tf`, configure your AWS provider and Terraform settings:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
provider "aws" {
  # The AWS region in which all resources will be created
  region = var.aws_region

  # Require a 2.x version of the AWS provider
  version = "~> 2.6"

  # Only these AWS Account IDs may be operated on by this template
  allowed_account_ids = [var.aws_account_id]
}

terraform {
  # The configuration for this backend will be filled in by Terragrunt or via a backend.hcl file. See
  # https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/config.html#partial-configuration
  backend "s3" {}

  # Only allow this Terraform version. Note that if you upgrade to a newer version, Terraform won't allow you to use an
  # older version, so when you upgrade, you should upgrade everyone on your team and your CI servers all at once.
  required_version = "= 0.12.6"
}
----

Next, use the `eks-cluster-control-plane` module to configure the EKS control plane:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
module "eks_cluster" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest terraform-aws-eks release
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks.git//modules/eks-cluster-control-plane?ref=<VERSION>"

  cluster_name = var.cluster_name

  vpc_id                = data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.vpc_id
  vpc_master_subnet_ids = data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.private_app_subnet_ids

  enabled_cluster_log_types = ["api", "audit", "authenticator"]
  kubernetes_version        = 1.13
  endpoint_public_access    = false
}
----

The code above does the following:

* Fetch information about the app VPC you just deployed using the
  https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/terraform/d/remote_state.html[terraform_remote_state data source]. You'll see
  the code for this shortly.
* Configure the control plane to run in the private app subnets of that VPC.
* Configure the API server logs, audit logs, and authenticator logs for the control plane to be sent to CloudWatch.
* Set the Kubernetes version to 1.13.
* Disable public access so that the Kubernetes API server is only accessible from within the VPC.
+
NOTE: This means you MUST be in the VPC network—e.g., connected via a VPN—to access your EKS cluster.

Add the `terraform_remote_state` data source to fetch the app VPC info to `dependencies.tf`:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/dependencies.tf
[source,hcl]
----
data "terraform_remote_state" "vpc" {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    region = var.terraform_state_aws_region
    bucket = var.terraform_state_s3_bucket
    key    = "${var.aws_region}/${var.vpc_name}/vpc/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
----

And add the corresponding input variables for this code to `variables.tf`:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/variables.tf

variable "aws_region" {

variable "terraform_state_s3_bucket" {

=== Configure the worker nodes

The next step is to configure the worker nodes in the `eks-cluster` module. You can use an Auto Scaling Group to run
the worker nodes using the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/tree/master/modules/eks-cluster-workers[eks-cluster-workers] module
in `terraform-aws-eks`:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
module "eks_workers" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest terraform-aws-eks release
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks.git//modules/eks-cluster-workers?ref=<VERSION>"

  name_prefix  = "app-workers-"
  cluster_name = var.cluster_name

  vpc_id                = data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.vpc_id
  vpc_worker_subnet_ids = data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.private_app_subnet_ids

  eks_master_security_group_id = module.eks_cluster.eks_master_security_group_id

  cluster_min_size = var.cluster_min_size
  cluster_max_size = var.cluster_max_size

  cluster_instance_ami          = var.cluster_instance_ami
  cluster_instance_type         = var.cluster_instance_type
  cluster_instance_keypair_name = var.cluster_instance_keypair_name
  cluster_instance_user_data    = data.template_file.user_data.rendered
}
----

The code above does the following:

* Deploy the worker nodes into the same private app subnets as the EKS cluster.
* Pass in the EKS control plane security group ID to the `eks_master_security_group_id`. The `eks-cluster-workers`
  module will use this to open up the proper ports in the control plane and worker node security groups so they can
  talk to each other.
* Use variables for most of the other worker node settings: e.g., min number of nodes, max number of nodes, AMI to run,
  instance type to run, and so on. This allows you to use different settings for the worker nodes in different
  environments.
* Sets the worker nodes to run a User Data script rendered from a `template_file` data source. You'll see what this
  `template_file` data source looks like a little later.

Add the corresponding input variables to `variables.tf`:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/variables.tf
[source,hcl]
----
variable "cluster_min_size" {
  description = "The minimum number of instances to run in the EKS cluster"
  type        = number
}

variable "cluster_max_size" {
  description = "The maximum number of instances to run in the EKS cluster"
  type        = number
}

variable "cluster_instance_type" {
  description = "The type of instances to run in the EKS cluster (e.g. t2.medium)"
  type        = string
}

variable "cluster_instance_ami" {
  description = "The AMI to run on each instance in the EKS cluster. You can build the AMI using the Packer template under packer/build.json."
  type        = string
}

variable "cluster_instance_keypair_name" {
  description = "The name of the Key Pair that can be used to SSH to each instance in the EKS cluster"
  type        = string
}
----

=== Create the worker node AMI

The next step is to create the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that will run on each worker node. We recommend using the
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-optimized-ami.html[Amazon EKS-Optimized AMI] as the base and
installing other tooling you need (e.g., server-hardening, monitoring, log aggregation, etc.) on top of it.

Create a https://www.packer.io[Packer] template in called `eks-node.json` in your `infrastructure-modules` repo:

----
infrastructure-modules
  └ networking
    └ vpc-mgmt
    └ vpc-app
  └ services
    └ eks-cluster
      └ packer
        └ eks-node.json
      └ main.tf
      └ dependencies.tf
      └ outputs.tf
      └ variables.tf
----

Here's what `eks-node.json` should look like:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/packer/eks-node.json
[source,json]

}
----

[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: You must be a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscriber# to access the `terraform-aws-eks`,
`module-aws-monitoring`, and `module-security` repos used in the Packer template above.

This Packer template installs the following on top of the EKS-optimized AMI base image:

* https://github.com/gruntwork-io/bash-commons[bash-commons]: A collection of reusable Bash functions for handling
  common tasks such as logging, assertions, string manipulation, and more. It's used by some of the other tooling below.

* https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/tree/master/modules/eks-scripts[eks-scripts]: A script that takes
  the labels on a worker node EC2 instance and converts them to a format that can be passed to the EKS bootstrap script
  so that those tags show up as labels in Kubernetes.

* https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-aws-monitoring/tree/master/modules/metrics/cloudwatch-memory-disk-metrics-scripts[cloudwatch-memory-disk-metrics-scripts]:
  Send memory and disk usage metrics for your EC2 Instances to CloudWatch. These metrics are not available by default
  as they are only visible from inside a VM.

* https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-aws-monitoring/tree/master/modules/logs/syslog[syslog]: Configure log rotation
  and rate limiting for syslog.

* https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security/tree/master/modules/auto-update[auto-update]: Configure a Linux
  server to automatically install critical security updates on a nightly basis.

* https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security/tree/master/modules/fail2ban[fail2ban]: Configure a Linux server to
  automatically ban malicious ip addresses from connecting to the server via SSH.

* https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security/tree/master/modules/ntp[ntp]: Install and configure NTP on a Linux
  server to prevent clock drift.

* https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security/tree/master/modules/ip-lockdown[ip-lockdown]: Lock down specified IP
  addresses so only certain OS users can access them. Primarily used to lock down the EC2 instance metadata endpoint
  (and therefore, the IAM role attached to the EC2 instance) so that it can only be accessed by specific users (e.g.,
  only `root`).

* https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security/tree/master/modules/ssh-grunt[ssh-grunt]: Allow managing SSH access
  to EC2 instances using IAM. Developers you add to specific IAM groups will be able to SSH to specific servers using
  their own username and SSH key.

To build an AMI from this Packer template, you run:

[source,bash]
----
packer build eks-node.json
----

Packer will output the ID of the AMI at the end of the build. Copy this AMI down so you can deploy it later in this
guide.

=== Configure the worker node User Data script

Now that you know what will be installed on each worker node AMI, you can fill in the User Data script that each worker
node will run on boot. Create `user-data.sh` in your `infrastructure-modules` repo:

----
infrastructure-modules
  └ networking
    └ vpc-mgmt
    └ vpc-app
  └ services
    └ eks-cluster
      └ packer
        └ eks-node.json
      └ user-data
        └ user-data.sh
      └ main.tf
      └ dependencies.tf
      └ outputs.tf
      └ variables.tf
----

Here's what `user-data.sh` should look like:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/user-data/user-data.sh
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

set -e

# Send the log output from this script to user-data.log, syslog, and the console
# From: https://alestic.com/2010/12/ec2-user-data-output/
exec > >(tee /var/log/user-data.log|logger -t user-data -s 2>/dev/console) 2>&1

function start_fail2ban {
  echo "Starting fail2ban"
  /etc/user-data/configure-fail2ban-cloudwatch/configure-fail2ban-cloudwatch.sh --cloudwatch-namespace Fail2Ban
}

function start_cloudwatch_logs_agent {
  local -r vpc_name="$1"
  local -r log_group_name="$2"

  echo "Starting CloudWatch Logs Agent in VPC $vpc_name"
  /etc/user-data/cloudwatch-log-aggregation/run-cloudwatch-logs-agent.sh \
    --vpc-name "$vpc_name" \
    --log-group-name "$log_group_name"
}

function configure_eks_instance {
  local -r aws_region="$1"
  local -r eks_cluster_name="$2"
  local -r eks_endpoint="$3"
  local -r eks_certificate_authority="$4"
  local -r vpc_name="$5"
  local -r log_group_name="$6"

  start_cloudwatch_logs_agent "$vpc_name" "$log_group_name"
  start_fail2ban

  echo "Running eks bootstrap script to register instance to cluster"
  local -r node_labels="$(map-ec2-tags-to-node-labels)"
  /etc/eks/bootstrap.sh \
    --apiserver-endpoint "$eks_endpoint" \
    --b64-cluster-ca "$eks_certificate_authority" \
    --kubelet-extra-args "--node-labels=\"$node_labels\"" \
    "$eks_cluster_name"

  echo "Locking down the EC2 metadata endpoint so only the root and default users can access it"
  /usr/local/bin/ip-lockdown 169.254.169.254 root ec2-user
}

# These variables are set by Terraform interpolation
configure_eks_instance "${aws_region}" "${eks_cluster_name}" "${eks_endpoint}" "${eks_certificate_authority}" "${vpc_name}" "${log_group_name}"
----

The User Data script above does the following:

* Starts the CloudWatch Logs Agent so that logs from the EC2 instance (especially syslog) are sent to CloudWatch Logs.
* Starts `fail2ban` to protect the instance against malicious SSH attempts.
* Runs the EKS bootstrap script to register the instance in the cluster.
* Run `ip-lockdown` to lock down the EC2 metadata endpoint so only the `root` and `ec2-user` users can access it.

Note that at the bottom of `user-data.sh`, there are some variables that are supposed to be filled in by Terraform
interpolation. How does that work? When you configured the worker nodes earlier in this guide, you set the
`cluster_instance_user_data` parameter to a `template_file` data source that didn't yet exist; well, this is what's
going to provide the variables via interpolation! Add the `template_file` data source as follows:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
data "template_file" "user_data" {
  template = file("${path.module}/user-data/user-data.sh")

  vars = {
    aws_region                = var.aws_region
    eks_cluster_name          = var.cluster_name
    eks_endpoint              = module.eks_cluster.eks_cluster_endpoint
    eks_certificate_authority = module.eks_cluster.eks_cluster_certificate_authority
    vpc_name                  = var.vpc_name
    log_group_name            = var.cluster_name
  }
}
----

=== Configure logging, metrics, and alarms for the worker nodes

In order for the CloudWatch Logs Agent to be able to write to CloudWatch Logs, you need to give it the worker nodes the
proper IAM permissions. You can do that by using the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-aws-monitoring/tree/master/modules/logs/cloudwatch-log-aggregation-iam-policy[cloudwatch-log-aggregation-iam-policy module]
from `module-aws-monitoring`:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
module "cloudwatch_log_aggregation" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest module-aws-monitoring release
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-aws-monitoring.git//modules/logs/cloudwatch-log-aggregation-iam-policy?ref=<VERSION>"

  name_prefix = var.cluster_name
}

resource "aws_iam_policy_attachment" "attach_cloudwatch_log_aggregation_policy" {
  name       = "attach-cloudwatch-log-aggregation-policy"
  roles      = [module.eks_workers.eks_worker_iam_role_name]
  policy_arn = module.cloudwatch_log_aggregation.cloudwatch_log_aggregation_policy_arn
}
----

Similarly, to be able to send disk and memory metrics to CloudWatch, you need to add more IAM permissions, this time
using the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-aws-monitoring/tree/master/modules/metrics/cloudwatch-custom-metrics-iam-policy[cloudwatch-custom-metrics-iam-policy module]:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
module "cloudwatch_metrics" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest module-aws-monitoring release
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-aws-monitoring.git//modules/metrics/cloudwatch-custom-metrics-iam-policy?ref=<VERSION>"

  name_prefix = var.cluster_name
}

resource "aws_iam_policy_attachment" "attach_cloudwatch_metrics_policy" {
  name       = "attach-cloudwatch-metrics-policy"
  roles      = [module.eks_workers.eks_worker_iam_role_name]
  policy_arn = module.cloudwatch_metrics.cloudwatch_metrics_policy_arn
}
----

Finally, you may want to configure some CloudWatch alerts to go off if the CPU usage, memory usage, or disk space
utilization gets too high on the worker nodes. You can do this using several of the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-aws-monitoring/tree/master/modules/alarms[alarms modules] from
`module-aws-monitoring`:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
module "high_cpu_usage_alarms" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest module-aws-monitoring release
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-aws-monitoring.git//modules/alarms/asg-cpu-alarms?ref=<VERSION>"

  asg_names            = [module.eks_workers.eks_worker_asg_id]
  num_asg_names        = 1
  alarm_sns_topic_arns = [data.terraform_remote_state.sns_region.outputs.arn]
}

module "high_memory_usage_alarms" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest module-aws-monitoring release
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-aws-monitoring.git//modules/alarms/asg-memory-alarms?ref=<VERSION>"

  asg_names            = [module.eks_workers.eks_worker_asg_id]
  num_asg_names        = 1
  alarm_sns_topic_arns = [data.terraform_remote_state.sns_region.outputs.arn]
}

module "high_disk_usage_alarms" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest module-aws-monitoring release
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-aws-monitoring.git//modules/alarms/asg-disk-alarms?ref=<VERSION>"

  asg_names            = [module.eks_workers.eks_worker_asg_id]
  num_asg_names        = 1
  file_system          = "/dev/xvda1"
  mount_path           = "/"
  alarm_sns_topic_arns = [data.terraform_remote_state.sns_region.outputs.arn]
}
----

Note that the code above assumes you've created an SNS topic to notify about these alerts in another module and pulls
in the ARN of that SNS topic using a `terraform_remote_state` data source:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/dependencies.tf
[source,hcl]
----
data "terraform_remote_state" "sns_region" {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    region = var.terraform_state_aws_region
    bucket = var.terraform_state_s3_bucket
    key    = "${var.aws_region}/_global/sns-topics/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
----

=== Configure role mapping

When you deploy the `eks-cluster` module later in this guide, it'll give your IAM user or IAM role (whatever you're
authenticated as) admin permissions in the cluster. You can use these admin permissions to configure permissions for
the other IAM users and roles on your team using the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/tree/master/modules/eks-k8s-role-mapping[eks-k8s-role-mapping module]
in `terraform-aws-eks`:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
module "eks_k8s_role_mapping" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest terraform-aws-eks release
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks.git//modules/eks-k8s-role-mapping?ref=<VERSION>"

  # This will configure the worker nodes' IAM role to have access to the system:node Kubernetes role
  eks_worker_iam_role_arns = [module.eks_workers.eks_worker_iam_role_arn]

  # The IAM role to Kubernetes role mappings are passed in via a variable
  iam_role_to_rbac_group_mappings = var.iam_role_to_rbac_group_mappings

  config_map_labels = {
    eks-cluster = module.eks_cluster.eks_cluster_name
  }
}
----

And here's the corresponding input variable:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/variables.tf
[source,hcl]
----
variable "iam_role_to_rbac_group_mappings" {
  description = "Mapping of AWS IAM roles to RBAC groups, where the keys are the AWS ARN of IAM roles and the values are the mapped k8s RBAC group names as a list."
  type        = map(list(string))
  default     = {}
}
----

This variable allows you to map different IAM role ARNs in different environments to various Kubernetes roles. You'll
see an example of this later in the guide.

Note that the `eks-k8s-role-mapping` module uses the Kubernetes provider to talk to your Kubernetes cluster directly
from Terraform. That means that (a) you can only apply this code from within your VPC and/or when connected via VPN and
(b) you have to configure the Kubernetes provider. The latter requires a little bit of hackery due to Terraform
limitations:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
provider "kubernetes" {
  version = "~> 1.6"

  load_config_file       = false
  host                   = data.template_file.kubernetes_cluster_endpoint.rendered
  cluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(data.template_file.kubernetes_cluster_ca.rendered)
  token                  = data.aws_eks_cluster_auth.kubernetes_token.token
}

# Workaround for Terraform limitation where you cannot directly set a depends on directive or interpolate from resources
# in the provider config.
# Specifically, Terraform requires all information for the Terraform provider config to be available at plan time,
# meaning there can be no computed resources. We work around this limitation by creating a template_file data source
# that does the computation.
# See https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/2430 for more details
data "template_file" "kubernetes_cluster_endpoint" {
  template = module.eks_cluster.eks_cluster_endpoint
}

data "template_file" "kubernetes_cluster_ca" {
  template = module.eks_cluster.eks_cluster_certificate_authority
}

data "aws_eks_cluster_auth" "kubernetes_token" {
  name = module.eks_cluster.eks_cluster_name
}
----

=== Configure access to the control plane and worker nodes

If you want to make the control plane accessible outside of the cluster itself, you can add additional security group
rules. For example, here is how you can make it possible to connect to the control plane from a VPN server:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "openvpn_server_control_plane_access" {
  type                     = "ingress"
  from_port                = 443
  to_port                  = 443
  protocol                 = "tcp"
  security_group_id        = module.eks_cluster.eks_master_security_group_id
  # Replace <SECURITY_GROUP_ID> with the ID of a security group from which SSH access should be allowed. E.g., If you
  # are running a VPN server, you could use a terraform_remote_state data source to fetch its security group ID and
  # fill it in here.
  source_security_group_id = "<VPN_SECURITY_GROUP_ID>"
}
----

Note that if the VPN server is in another VPC (e.g., a management VPC), you will need to add DNS forwarding rules in
order for the VPN server to be able to resolve the private domain name of the EKS cluster. You can add these rules
using the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-vpc/tree/master/modules/vpc-dns-forwarder-rules[vpc-dns-forwarder-rules module]
from `terraform-aws-eks`:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
module "dns_forwarder_rule" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest terraform-aws-eks release
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-vpc.git//modules/vpc-dns-forwarder-rules?ref=<VERSION>"

  vpc_id                                        = data.terraform_remote_state.mgmt_vpc.outputs.vpc_id
  origin_vpc_route53_resolver_endpoint_id       = data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.origin_vpc_route53_resolver_endpoint_id
  destination_vpc_route53_resolver_primary_ip   = data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.destination_vpc_route53_resolver_primary_ip
  destination_vpc_route53_resolver_secondary_ip = data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.destination_vpc_route53_resolver_secondary_ip

  num_endpoints_to_resolve = 1
  endpoints_to_resolve = [
    # endpoint returned here is of the form https://DOMAIN. We want just the domain, so we chop off the https
    replace(lower(module.eks_cluster.eks_cluster_endpoint), "https://", ""),
  ]
}
----

Note that this code pulls in the ID of the management VPC via a `terraform_remote_state` data source:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/dependencies.tf
[source,hcl]
----
data "terraform_remote_state" "mgmt_vpc" {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    region = var.terraform_state_aws_region
    bucket = var.terraform_state_s3_bucket
    key    = "${var.aws_region}/mgmt/vpc/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
----

If you want to be able to SSH to the worker nodes (e.g., for debugging), you can update the worker nodes security group
to allow SSH access from specific IPs or security groups:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "allow_inbound_ssh" {
  type                     = "ingress"
  from_port                = 22
  to_port                  = 22
  protocol                 = "tcp"
  security_group_id        = module.eks_workers.eks_worker_security_group_id
  # Replace <SECURITY_GROUP_ID> with the ID of a security group from which SSH access should be allowed. E.g., If you
  # are running a VPN server, you could use a terraform_remote_state data source to fetch its security group ID and
  # fill it in here.
  source_security_group_id = "<VPN_SECURITY_GROUP_ID>"
}
----

If you're using https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security/tree/master/modules/ssh-grunt[ssh-grunt] from
`module-security` to manage SSH access with IAM groups, you'll need to give the worker nodes IAM permissions to talk to
IAM. You can do this using the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security/tree/master/modules/iam-policies[iam-policies] module from
`module-security`:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
module "iam_policies" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest terraform-aws-eks release
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-security.git//modules/iam-policies?ref=<VERSION>"

  aws_account_id = var.aws_account_id

  # ssh-grunt is an automated app, so we can't use MFA with it
  iam_policy_should_require_mfa   = false
  trust_policy_should_require_mfa = false

  # If your IAM users are defined in a separate AWS account (e.g., a security account), you can pass in the ARN of
  # of that account via an input variable, and the IAM policy will give the worker nodes permission to assume that
  # IAM role
  allow_access_to_other_account_arns = [var.external_account_ssh_grunt_role_arn]
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "ssh_grunt_permissions" {
  name   = "ssh-grunt-permissions"
  role   = module.eks_workers.eks_worker_iam_role_name
  policy = module.iam_policies.allow_access_to_other_accounts[0]
}
----

=== Deploy the EKS cluster

Your `eks-cluster` module is nearly complete! The only thing left to do is to add some useful output variables to
`outputs.tf`:

.infrastructure-modules/services/eks-cluster/outputs.tf
[source,hcl]
----
output "aws_region" {
  value = var.aws_region
}

output "eks_cluster_arn" {
  value = module.eks_cluster.eks_cluster_arn
}

output "eks_cluster_name" {
  value = module.eks_cluster.eks_cluster_name
}

output "eks_cluster_asg_name" {
  value = module.eks_workers.eks_worker_asg_name
}

output "eks_worker_security_group_id" {
  value = module.eks_workers.eks_worker_security_group_id
}

output "eks_worker_iam_role_arn" {
  value = module.eks_workers.eks_worker_iam_role_arn
}

output "eks_worker_iam_role_name" {
  value = module.eks_workers.eks_worker_iam_role_name
}

output "asg_name" {
  value = module.eks_workers.eks_worker_asg_name
}
----

At this point, run manual and automated tests for your code. Once your `eks-cluster` module is working the way you
want, submit a pull request, get your changes merged into the `master` branch, and create a new versioned release by
using a Git tag:

[source,bash]
----
git tag -a "v0.6.0" -m "Added eks-cluster module"
git push --follow-tags
----

Head over to your `infrastructure-live` repo and create a `terragrunt.hcl` file to deploy your EKS cluster in one of
your environments, such as staging:

----
infrastructure-live
  └ root
  └ security
  └ stage
    └ us-east-2
      └ stage
        └ services
          └ eks-cluster
            └ terragrunt.hcl
  └ dev
  └ prod
  └ shared-services
----

Point the `source` URL in your `terragrunt.hcl` file to your `eks-cluster` module in the `infrastructure-modules`
repo, setting the `ref` param to the version you released earlier:

.infrastructure-live/stage/us-east-2/stage/services/eks-cluster/terragrunt.hcl
[source,hcl]
----
terraform {
  source = "git@github.com/<YOUR_ORG>/infrastructure-modules.git//services/eks-cluster?ref=v0.6.0"
}
----

Set the variables for the `cloudtrail` module in this environment in the `inputs = { ... }` block of `terragrunt.hcl`:

.infrastructure-live/stage/us-east-2/stage/services/eks-cluster/terragrunt.hcl
[source,hcl]
----
inputs = {
  cluster_name                  = "eks-stage"
  cluster_instance_keypair_name = "stage-services-us-east-1-v1"

  # Fill in the ID of the AMI you built from your Packer template
  cluster_instance_ami          = "<AMI_ID>"

  # Set the max size to double the min size so the extra capacity can be used to do a zero-downtime deployment of updates
  # to the EKS Cluster Nodes (e.g. when you update the AMI). For docs on how to roll out updates to the cluster, see:
  # https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/tree/master/modules/eks-cluster-workers#how-do-i-roll-out-an-update-to-the-instances
  cluster_min_size      = 3
  cluster_max_size      = 6
  cluster_instance_type = "t2.small"

  # If your IAM users are defined in a separate AWS account (e.g., in a security account), pass in the ARN of an IAM
  # role in that account that ssh-grunt on the worker nodes can assume to look up IAM group membership and public SSH
  # keys
  external_account_ssh_grunt_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::1111222233333:role/allow-ssh-grunt-access-from-other-accounts"

  # Configure your role mappings
  iam_role_to_rbac_group_mappings = {
    # Give anyone using the full-access IAM role admin permissions
    "arn:aws:iam::444444444444:role/allow-full-access-from-other-accounts" = ["system:masters"]

    # Give anyone using the developers IAM role developer permissions. Kubernetes will automatically create this group
    # if it doesn't exist already, but you're still responsible for binding permissions to it!
    "arn:aws:iam::444444444444:role/allow-dev-access-from-other-accounts" = ["developers"]
  }
}
----

Configure your Terraform backend:

.infrastructure-live/stage/us-east-2/stage/services/eks-cluster/terragrunt.hcl
[source,hcl]
----
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
----

And run `terragrunt apply` to deploy the EKS cluster:

[source,bash]
----
cd infrastructure-live/stage/us-east-2/stage/services/eks-cluster
terragrunt apply
----

// TODO: Commented out for now. This probably belongs in a separate guide on how to deploy services on top of
// Kubernetes. That guide can talk about Helm, load balancing, etc.

//
//- ingress controller
//- ingress controller IAM permissions

//. Any services you deploy that need to work with the ingress controller will have to set their type to `NodePort`.
//. Update the worker node security group to allow inbound requests from the ALB.

//- https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/tree/master/modules/eks-k8s-external-dns

=== Try out the cluster

At this point, you can start interacting with your EKS cluster using `kubectl`. First, configure `kubectl` to
authenticate to the cluster. Here's an example of how to do that using
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt[kubergrunt]:

[source,bash]
----
kubergrunt eks configure --eks-cluster-arn <EKS_CLUSTER_ARN>
----

You'll need to replace `EKS_CLUSTER_ARN` with the ARN of the EKS cluster, which is one of the outputs you'll get at the
end of the `terragrunt apply`.

Now you can start running typical `kubectl` commands:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get nodes
----

=== Updating the worker nodes

Deploying the cluster initially is a start. In the future, you'll also need a way to roll out updates:

Updating the control plane::
  EKS has built-in support for updating the control plane; the `eks-cluster-control-plane` module has built-in support
  for updating the plugins EKS uses, such as `aws-vpc-cni`, `coredns`, and `kube-proxy`. So, if you bump your Kubernetes
  version and run `terragrunt apply`, EKS will automatically roll out new master nodes with the new version installed,
  and the `eks-cluster-control-plane` module will automatically execute a Python script that will update all the plugin
  versions as described in the
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-cluster.html[official upgrade guide].
+
NOTE: AWS warns that you may "experience minor service interruptions during an update." See
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-cluster.html[Updating an Amazon EKS Cluster Kubernetes Version]
for more info.

Updating the worker nodes::
  EKS does not have a built-in way to update the worker nodes without downtime. If you need to update the worker
  nodes—e.g., roll out a new AMI—your best bet is to use the
  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt#deploy[kubergrunt deploy] command, which can do a zero-downtime rolling
  deployment of the worker node Auto Scaling Group:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubergrunt eks deploy --region <AWS_REGION> --asg-name <AUTO_SCALING_GROUP_NAME>
----
