== Intro

This guide walks you through how to update v1.0 of the https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/[Gruntwork Reference
Architecture], which uses a private `infrastructure-modules` repo, to v2.0, which uses the
https://blog.gruntwork.io/introducing-the-gruntwork-module-service-and-architecture-catalogs-eb3a21b99f70[Gruntwork
Service Catalog]. The Gruntwork Service Catalog is a set of dozens of highly configurable, battle-tested,
production-grade _services_ that you can deploy off-the-shelf without writing any code. Many modules offered in the
`infrastructure-modules` repository of the Gruntwork Reference Architecture are fully replaced with the Service Catalog,
eliminating the need to maintain snapshots of the Services in your own repository.

=== What you'll learn in this guide

This guide consists of two main sections:

<<core_concepts>>::
  An overview of the differences between the Service Catalog and v1.0 of the Gruntwork Reference Architecture.

<<deployment_walkthrough>>::
  The steps you need to take to update your code from v1.0 of the Gruntwork Reference Architecture to work with the
  Service Catalog. Includes dedicated <<service_migration_guides,service migration guides>> you can use to update on a
  module by module basis.


[[core_concepts]]
== Core Concepts

=== Background

On August 26th, 2020, we announced the initial release of
https://blog.gruntwork.io/introducing-the-gruntwork-module-service-and-architecture-catalogs-eb3a21b99f70[the Service
Catalog] in a private, invite-only alpha program. Since then we have expanded the catalog to be generally available,
with all Gruntwork subscribers getting access to the services of the catalog. A _service_ includes everything you need
in production, including the Terraform code for provisioning, Packer templates or Dockerfiles for configuration
management, built-in monitoring (metrics, logging, alerting), built-in security features (SSH access, secrets
management, server hardening, encryption in transit and at rest), and so on. This allows you to deploy infrastructure
without writing any code.

Prior to the release of the Service Catalog, the Gruntwork Reference Architecture included a customized set of services
in the form of a private `infrastructure-modules` repository for each customer. These services required continuous
maintenance from the end users to keep up to date with each change, including updating module references when new
versions were released.

Now with the Service Catalog, there is no longer a need to maintain a separate service module for every component you use.
Instead, you can rely on the battle tested, Gruntwork maintained service module in the Service Catalog!

If you haven't made any modifications to a service since receiving the Reference Architecture, we recommend updating
your `infrastructure-live` configuration to use the service modules from the Service Catalog instead of using and
maintaining your copy in `infrastructure-modules`. Using the Service Catalog directly has several advantages:

* Keep up to date with module releases with a single version bump in your Terragrunt live configuration, as opposed to
  updating each module block reference.
* Update to a new, backward incompatible Terraform version with a single version bump as well. No need to track backward
  incompatible syntactical changes in Terraform!
* Rely on Gruntwork to provide feature updates and bug fixes to the services.

Though the Service Catalog fully replaces the services defined in your `infrastructure-modules` repository, there are
some differences that require you to make modifications to Terragrunt configurations in your `infrastructure-live`
repository before you can start using the Service Catalog.


[[deployment_walkthrough]]
== Deployment Walkthrough

Your goal in this walkthrough is to replace references to `infrastructure-modules` with `terraform-aws-service-catalog`,
within your `infrastructure-live` repo. You will follow a two-step process:

* Step 1: Prepare your Terragrunt `infrastructure-live` configuration to support the Service Catalog
* Step 2: Update each Terragrunt live configuration to use the Service Catalog

IMPORTANT: This guide assumes a minimum terragrunt version of
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.28.18[0.28.18]. If you are using an older terragrunt version,
be sure to update to at least this version first.

=== Step 1: Prepare your Terragrunt configuration to support the Service Catalog

The Terraform modules in the Service Catalog are missing some required blocks for Terraform to operate (e.g., the
`provider` and `terraform` state backend blocks). This is by design, to allow the modules to be flexibly used in
different contexts (unlike the `infrastructure-modules` modules which are only intended to be used in the Terragrunt
context). As such, you need to inject these required blocks to use advanced features of Terragrunt. Here we define a new
root `terragrunt.hcl` configuration that includes these directives so that we can continue to use the original,
non-Service Catalog based live configuration.

For reference, you can download the link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-live-multi-account-acme/releases/tag/v0.0.1-20210527[refarch-folder-structure]
zip file which contains all the following files in their respective locations in the folder structure. You can copy
these files into your own `infrastructure-live` repository.

[arabic]
. Create a new file `terragrunt_service_catalog.hcl` at the root of the `infrastructure-live` repository. We name this
  differently from the existing `terragrunt.hcl` so that the modules that haven't migrated yet won't be affected.
. Insert the following contents:
+
....
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TERRAGRUNT CONFIGURATION
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

locals {
  common_vars  = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("common.hcl"))
  account_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("account.hcl"))

  # Optional: Update to use HCL instead of YAML
  region_vars  = yamldecode(file(find_in_parent_folders("region.yaml")))

  name_prefix    = local.common_vars.locals.name_prefix
  account_name   = local.account_vars.locals.account_name
  account_id     = local.account_vars.locals.account_id
  default_region = local.common_vars.locals.default_region
  aws_region     = local.region_vars["aws_region"]
}

 # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GENERATED PROVIDER BLOCK
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

generate "provider" {
  path      = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = <<EOF
provider "aws" {
  region = "${local.aws_region}"
  version = ">= 3.13.0"
  # Only these AWS Account IDs may be operated on by this template
  allowed_account_ids = ["${local.account_id}"]
}
EOF
}

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GENERATED REMOTE STATE BLOCK
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Configure Terragrunt to automatically store tfstate files in an S3 bucket
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    encrypt        = true
    bucket         = "${local.name_prefix}-${local.account_name}-terraform-state"
    region         = local.default_region
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    # To ensure that the state paths are the same as before, we drop the account folder (the first path element)
    # which is now included in the relative path.
    key            = trimprefix("${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate", "${local.account_name}/")
  }
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
}

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GLOBAL PARAMETERS
# These variables apply to all configurations in this subfolder. These are automatically merged into the child
# `terragrunt.hcl` config via the include block.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

inputs = {
  # Many modules require these two inputs, so we set them globally here to keep all the child terragrunt.hcl files more
  # DRY
  aws_account_id = local.account_id
  aws_region     = local.aws_region
}
....
+
[NOTE]
.Explanation
====
In the non-Service Catalog flavor of the Reference Architecture, we had a root configuration for each account to ensure
that we can create a different state bucket for each account. While this isn't necessary for the Service Catalog, we
switch to a single root `terragrunt.hcl` config here (which is possible due to the advanced functions that are available
in newer Terragrunt versions) because there are more common blocks that are necessary, and we want to keep these
blocks DRY.

To support the new requirements of the Service Catalog, we also introduce two code generation configuration:

* `generate "provider"`: Uses the terragrunt
  https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-terraform-code-dry/#dry-common-terraform-code-with-terragrunt-generate-blocks[code
  generation] feature to inject the provider block into the module prior to invoking terraform.
* `generate` attribute of the `remote_state` block: Similar to the provider block generation, this attribute injects the
  `terraform.backend` configuration.

Finally, we introduce a `locals` block to define references that can be reused throughout the configuration. Note that
for new commonly used variables, we use `read_terragrunt_config` instead of `yamldecode(file())` to allow for use of
terragrunt functions in the config.

Note that the suggested config continues to use the `region.yaml` data file to simplify the migration process. You can
optionally update this file to `hcl` for consistency.
====
+
. Create new data files for the root config (these are the files that are read in in the `locals` blocks):
* In the root of the `infrastructure-live` repository, add a `common.hcl` file with the following contents:
+
....
locals {
  # TODO: A unique name prefix to set for all infrastructure resources created in your accounts.
  name_prefix = ""
  # TODO: the default AWS region to use. This should be the same as where the terraform state S3 bucket is
  # currently provisioned.
  default_region = ""
}
....

* In each account folder (e.g., `infrastructure-live/dev` or `infrastructure-live/shared`), add a file named
  `account.hcl` with the following contents:
+
....
locals {
  # TODO: Update with the actual information for each account
  # The user friendly name of the AWS account. Usually matches the folder name.
  account_name = ""
  # The 12 digit ID number for your AWS account.
  account_id = ""
}
....

* (optional) If you wish to replace your yaml variable files with HCL, in each region folder (e.g.,
  `infrastructure-live/dev/us-east-2`), add a file named `region.hcl` with the following contents:
+
....
locals {
  # TODO: enter the region to use for all resources in this subfolder.
  aws_region = ""
}
....
+
Note that you will want to have a `region.hcl` file for the `_global` folder as well. In this case, set the `aws_region`
to `us-east-1`.

. Create migration helper scripts (these are used by the Gruntwork Service Catalog Terraform state migration bash
  scripts):

.. Create a new directory `_scripts` at the root of the `infrastructure-live` repository.
.. Create a new file `migration_helpers.sh` in the newly created `_scripts` folder and paste in the following contents:
+

=== Step 2: Update each Terragrunt live configuration to use the Service Catalog

At this point, you are ready to update each live configuration! It's important to take a bottom-up approach for migrating
the live configurations. That is, update live configurations that don't have any downstream dependencies first, then
work your way up the dependency graph.

This ensures that:

* Each update is self contained. Changing the live configuration of leaf services will not affect other live
  configurations, allowing you to continue to make changes to unmigrated live configurations.
* The migration is low risk. The leaf nodes in the Terragrunt infrastructure graph tend to be lower risk services.
  That is, the closer you are to the root of the graph, the higher the number of things that depend on that infrastructure,
  which gives that service a larger surface area. E.g., VPC has many downstream dependencies, which means that messing it
  up can cause lots of other services to fail.

However, this does mean that you will need to update previously migrated services if the upstream services
has a change. For example, Service Catalog services sometimes have output name changes, which means that you will need
to update the references in the downstream services when you update the service.

To handle this, you can identify all the downstream services that are affected by running `terragrunt validate-all` to
identify these broken links each time a service is updated, and fix them in the same PR.

Don't worry -- we're going to walk you through every step right now. At a high-level, here's what you'll do:

[arabic]
. Choose a service.
. Refer to the dedicated guide for that service.
. Backup the state file.
. Modify the `terragrunt.hcl` live configuration for it, following the guide.
. Validate the backend configuration with `terragrunt state list`.
. Validate the inputs with `terragrunt validate-inputs`.
. Run the state migration script, if any.
. Sanity check the changes with `terragrunt plan`.
. Roll out with `terragrunt apply`.

Some of the services, such as EKS and ASG, have slightly different steps to the above list, so please pay attention to that.

Now for the full-fledged instructions to upgrade a single service:

[arabic]
. Check the service's downstream dependencies. Use the `graph-dependencies` command to create
  a visual representation. The arrow points from the leaf to the root, toward the dependency. Thus in the graph,
  the top nodes are leaf nodes and the bottom, root nodes.
    * `terragrunt graph-dependencies | dot -Tpng > graph.png`
    * If you get an error that `dot` is not available, install https://www.graphviz.org/download/[graphviz], which
      installs the `dot` utility.
    * Here is an example of a dependency tree for the `dev` account using Reference Architecture v1.
    image:/assets/img/guides/ref-arch-v2-upgrade/ref-arch-v2-dep-tree.png[Dependency Graph]

. Ensure the module is updated to the same version used in Reference Architecture version
  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-modules-multi-account-acme/releases/tag/v0.0.1-20201125[20201125].
    * If you're running a newer version, continue.
    * If you are running an older version, follow the migration guides referenced in
      https://github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-modules-multi-account-acme/releases[the Reference Architecture
      releases] to update to the latest version. This is important because the Service Catalog module references use newer
      versions from the Module Catalog than what is shipped with v1.0 of the Reference Architecture. Once you've upgraded to
      https://github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-modules-multi-account-acme/releases/tag/v0.0.1-20201125[20201125],
      you can automate any state manipulations that are required to update a service using the provided guides and scripts.

. *Make a backup of the state file* using the following command: `terragrunt state pull > backup.tfstate`
   You can use this to rollback the state to before you attempted the migration with the
   following command: `terragrunt state push "$(pwd)/backup.tfstate"`.

* NOTE: Make sure to use the Terraform version that is required for your module, as specified in the
  https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/index.html#specifying-a-required-terraform-version[required_version]
  configuration of the module.

. Modify the `terragrunt.hcl` file to be compatible with the Service Catalog:
    * Change the `include` path to `find_in_parent_folders("terragrunt_service_catalog.hcl")`. This ensures that you use the
      Service Catalog compatible root config you created in the previous step.
    * Change the `terraform.source` attribute to point to the corresponding Terraform module in the
      `terraform-aws-service-catalog` repo. When updating the source, make sure to set the ref to target `v0.35.5`, unless otherwise noted down below in <<service_migration_guides>>.

+
[NOTE]
.Explanation
====
This migration guide targets `v0.35.5` of the Service Catalog, unless otherwise noted down below in <<service_migration_guides>>. Newer versions may require additional state migrations
that are not covered by the automated scripts. If you wish to update further, first update to `v0.35.5` and then read
the migration guides in the release notes of the Service Catalog to bump beyond that version.
====

    * Find the <<service_migration_guides,dedicated service migration guide>> for the service.
    * Using that guide, update the inputs to adapt to the Service Catalog Terraform module.
        * You can use `terragrunt validate-inputs` as a sanity check.
        * Remove the `dependencies` block, if any.
        * Use `dependency` blocks. Use <<service_migration_guides,the dedicated
          service migration guide>> as a reference for what dependency blocks are needed.
    * Add new required inputs, using `dependency` references as needed.
    * Remove or rename unused variables.
    * Ensure you include inputs for backward compatibility mentioned in the dedicated guide!

. Run `terragrunt state list` to sanity check the state backend configuration. Watch for the following:
    * You should NOT get any prompts from Terragrunt to create a new S3 state bucket. If you get the prompt, this means that
      either you are authenticating to the wrong account, or that the bucket name was misconfigured in the root
      `terragrunt_service_catalog.hcl` file.
    * You should see resources listed in the state. If the command returns nothing, that means you are not properly linked
      to the old state file. Double check the `key` attribute of the `remote_state` block in the root
      `terragrunt_service_catalog.hcl` config.

. Once you verify the state backend configuration is valid, perform the state migration operations:

.. *Run the provided migration script* for the service. Not all services have a migration script. Refer to the
    <<service_migration_guides,dedicated service migration guide>> for the script to run.
.. *Sanity check the migration operation* by running `terragrunt plan`. If the guide states that the upgrade is fully
   backward compatible, then you should only see backward compatible changes (only `~` or `+` operations, not `-`
   operations). Otherwise, expect some destroys.
* NOTE: If you run into any errors related to code verification during provider plugin initialization, you will need to
  update to the latest terraform patch version that contains the latest terraform GPG key to sign the providers. When
  updating the terraform version, you also need to run `terragrunt init` to reinitialize the providers. The
  following lists the minimum patch version that includes the latest GPG key:
** https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases/tag/v0.11.15[0.11.15]
** https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases/tag/v0.12.31[0.12.31]
** https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases/tag/v0.13.7[0.13.7]
** https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases/tag/v0.14.11[0.14.11]
** https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases/tag/v0.15.1[0.15.1]

. Once you're satisfied with the plan, roll out the changes using `terragrunt apply`.
. If the service has downstream dependencies, run `terragrunt validate-all` from the ACCOUNT directory to identify any
  outputs that have changed. Fix the output references on the `dependency` block for each error.

=== Appendix: Dedicated service migration guides

These dedicated guides are meant to be used in tandem with the main detailed guide above. They are stored in the
`infrastructure-live-multi-account-acme` repository, which is now archived because it was used to share examples
of Reference Architecture 1.0. You can still interact with the archived repo, and use it to help you upgrade your
existing Reference Architecture.

[NOTE]
.Exceptions to Service Catalog Versions
====
The following modules require a different version of the Service Catalog than `v0.35.5` to migrate properly:

- `route53-public`: `v0.32.0`
