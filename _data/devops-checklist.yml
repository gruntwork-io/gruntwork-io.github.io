    - title: Build AMIs
      description: |
        If you want to run your apps directly on EC2 Instances, you should package them as
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html" target="_blank">Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)</a>
        using a tool such as <a href="https://www.packer.io/" target="_blank">Packer</a>. Although we recommend Docker
        for all stateful apps (see below), we recommend directly using AMIs and EC2 Instances for all stateful apps,
        such as any data store (MySQL, MongoDB, Kafka), and app that writes to its local disk (e.g., WordPress, Jenkins).

    - title: Deploy AMIs using Auto Scaling Groups
      description: |
        The best way to deploy an AMI is typically to run it as an
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html" target="_blank">Auto Scaling Group</a>.
        This will allow you to spin up multiple EC2 Instances that run your AMI, scale the number of Instances up and
        down in response to load, and automatically replace failed Instances.

    - title: Build Docker images
      description: |
        If want to run your apps as containers, you should package your apps as
        <a href="http://docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> images and push those images to Amazon's
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/" target="_blank">Elastic Container Registry (ECR)</a>. We recommend
        Docker for all stateless apps and for local development (along with
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/" target="_blank">Docker Compose</a>).

    - title: Deploy Docker images using ECS, EKS, or Fargate
      description: |
        You have several options for running Docker containers in AWS. One is to use the
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank">Elastic Container Service (ECS)</a>, where you run a
        cluster of EC2 Instances, and Amazon takes care of scheduling containers across them. Another is
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/" target="_blank">Elasic Kubernetes Service (EKS)</a>, which is a Amazon's
        managed <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> (note, EKS is still in preview mode
        as of May, 2018). A third option is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/" target="_blank">AWS Fargate</a>,
        a service where AWS manages and scales the underlying Instances for you and you just hand it Docker containers
        to run.

    - title: Deploy serverless apps using Lambda and API Gateway
      description: |
        If want to build serverless apps, you should package them as
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/deployment-package-v2.html" target="_blank">deployment packages</a>
        for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank">AWS Lambda</a>. You can expose your Lambda
        functions as HTTP endpoints using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/" target="_blank">API Gateway</a>.

    - title: Configure CPU, memory, and GC settings
      description: |
        Configure memory settings CPU settings (e.g., ensure your app uses all available CPU cores using tools such
        as Node Cluster), memory settings (e.g., <code>-Xmx, -Xms</code> settings for the JVM), and GC settings (if
        applicable) for your app. If you're deploying directly on EC2 Instances, these should be configured based on
        the available CPU and memory on your Instance (see
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/" target="_blank">Instance Types</a>). If you are deploying
        Docker containers, then tell the scheduler the resources your app needs (e.g., in the
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html" target="_blank">ECS Task Definition</a>),
        and it will automatically try to find an EC2 Instance that has those resources.

    - title: Configure hard drives
      description: |
        Configure the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/RootDeviceStorage.html" target="_blank">root volume</a>
        on each EC2 Instance with enough space for your app and log files. Note that root volumes are deleted when an
        Instance is terminated, so if you are running stateful apps that need to persist data between redeploys (or
        between crashes), attach one or more
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumes.html" target="_blank">EBS Volumes</a>.

- category: Client-side apps
  items:
    - title: Pick a JavaScript framework
      description: |
        If you are building client-side applications in the browser, you may wish to use a JavaScript framework such as
        <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>,
        <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a>, or
        <a href="https://www.emberjs.com/" target="_blank">Ember</a>. You'll need to update your build system to
        build and package the code appropriately (see <a href="#continuous-integration">continuous integration</a>).

    - title: Pick a compile-to-JS language
      description: |
        JavaScript has a number of problems and limitations, so you may wish to use a compile-to-JS language, such as
        <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>,
        <a href="https://www.scala-js.org/" target="_blank">Scala.js</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/paf31/purescript" target="_blank">PureScript</a>,
        <a href="http://elm-lang.org/" target="_blank">Elm</a>, or
        <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript" target="_blank">ClojureScript</a>. You'll need to update
        your build system to build and package the code appropriately (see
        <a href="#continuous-integration">continuous integration</a>).

    - title: Pick a compile-to-CSS language
      description: |
        CSS has a number of problems and limitations, so you may wish to use a compile-to-CSS language, such as
        <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">SASS</a>,
        <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">less</a>,
        <a href="http://cssnext.io/" target="_blank">cssnext</a>, or
        <a href="https://github.com/postcss/postcss" target="_blank">postcss</a>. You'll need to update
        your build system to build and package the code appropriately (see
        <a href="#continuous-integration">continuous integration</a>).

    - title: Optimize your assets
      description: |
        All CSS and JavaScript should be minified and all images should be compressed. You may wish to concatenate
        your CSS and JavaScript files and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/" target="_blank">sprite images</a>
        to reduce the number of requests the browser has to make. Make sure to enable gzip compression. Much of this
        can be done using a build system such as
        <a href="https://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a>,
        <a href="https://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli" target="_blank">Broccoli</a>, or
        <a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank">webpack</a>.

    - title: Use a static content server
      description: |
        You should serve all your static content (CSS, JS, images, fonts) from a static content server so that your
        dynamic web framework (e.g., from Rails, Node.js, or Django) can focus solely on processing dynamic requests.
        The best static content host to use with AWS is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">S3</a>.

    - title: Use a CDN
      description: |
        Use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" target="_blank">CloudFront</a> as a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network" target="_blank">Content Distribution Network (CDN)</a>
        to cache and distribute your content across servers all over the world. This signicantly reduces latency for
        users and is especially effective for static content.

    - title: Configure caching
      description: |
        Think carefully about versioning, caching, and cache-busting for your static content. One option is to
        put the version number of each release directly in the URL (e.g., <code>/static/v3/foo.js</code>), which
        is easy to implement, but means 100% of your content is "cache buested" each release. Another option is "asset
        fingerprinting," where the build system renames each static content file with a hash of that files contents
        (e.g., <code>foo.js</code> becomes <code>908e25f4bf641868d8683022a5b62f54.js</code>), which is more complicated
        to implement (note: many build systems have built-in support), but ensures that only content that has changed
        is ever cache busted.

- category: Data storage
  items:
    - title: Deploy relational databases
      description: |
        Use Amazon's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" target="_blank">Relational Database Service (RDS)</a> to run
        MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, or MariaDB. Consider
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/" target="_blank">Amazon Aurora</a> as a highly scalable,
        cloud-native, MySQL and PostgreSQL compatible database. Both RDS and Aurora support automatic failover, read
        replicas, and automated backup.

    - title: Deploy NoSQL databases
      description: |
        Use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/" target="_blank">Elasticache</a> if you want to use Redis or
        Memcached for key-value storage. Use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" target="_blank">DynamoDB</a> if
        you need a managed, eventually consistent document store. If you need other NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB
        or Couchbase, you'll need to run it yoruself (see the
        <a href="https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/" target="_blank">Gruntwork Library</a>).

    - title: Deploy queues
      description: |
        Use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" target="_blank">Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</a> as a managed,
        distributed queue.

    - title: Deploy search tools
      description: |
        Use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/" target="_blank">Amazon Elasticsearch</a> for log
        analysis and full text search. Note that Amazon Elasticsearch has some
        <a href="https://code972.com/blog/2017/12/111-why-you-shouldnt-use-aws-elasticsearch-service" target="_blank">significant limitations</a>,
        so if you need to work around those, you'll need to run the ELK stack yourself (see the
        <a href="https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/" target="_blank">Gruntwork Library</a>).

    - title: Deploy stream processing tools
      description: |
        Use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/" target="_blank">Amazon Kinesis</a> to process streaming data.
        Note that Kinesis has some
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html" target="_blank">significant limitations</a>,
        so if you need to work around those, you'll need to instead run
        <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank">Kafka</a> yourself (see the
        <a href="https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/" target="_blank">Gruntwork Library</a>).

    - title: Deploy a data warehouse
      description: |
        Use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/" target="_blank">Amazon Redshift</a> for data warehousing.

    - title: Deploy big data systems
      description: |
        Use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/emr/" target="_blank">Amazon EMR</a> to run Hadoop, Spark, HBase, Presto,
        and Hive.

    - title: Set up cron jobs
      description: |
        Use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-scheduled-events.html" target="_blank">AWS Lambda Scheduled Events</a>
        or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduled_tasks.html" target="_blank">ECS Scheduled Tasks</a>
        to reliably run background jobs on a schedule (cron jobs). Look into
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/" target="_blank">AWS Step Functions</a> to build reliable,
        multi-step, distributed workflows.

    - title: Configure disk space
      description: |
        Configure enough disk space on your system for all the data you plan to store. If you are running a data
        storage system yourself, you'll probably want to store the data on one or more
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumes.html" target="_blank">EBS Volumes</a>
        that can be attached and detached as Instances are replaced. Note: using EBS Volumes with Auto Scaling Groups
        (ASGs) is very tricky, as ASGs can launch an Instance in any Availability Zone, but an EBS Volume can only be
        attached from the same Availability Zone (see the
        <a href="https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/" target="_blank">Gruntwork Library</a> for
        solutions).

    - title: Configure backup
      description: |
        Configure backup for all of your data stores. Most Amazon-managed data stores, such as RDS and Elasticache,
        support automated nightly snapshots. For backing up EC2 Instances and EBS Volumes, consider running
        <a href="https://github.com/josh-padnick/ec2-snapper" target="_blank">ec2-snapper</a> on a scheduled basis.

    - title: Configure cross-account backup
      description: |
        Copy all of your backups to a separate AWS account for extra redundancy. This ensures that if a disaster
        happens in one AWS account—e.g., an attacker gets in or someone accidentally deletes all the backups—you still
        have a copy of your data available elsewhere.

    - title: Test your backups
      description: |
        If you never test your backups, they probably don't work. Create automated tests that periodically restore from
        your backups to check they are actually working.

    - title: Set up schema management
      description: |
        For data stores that use a schema, such as relational databases, define the schema in schema migration files,
        check those files into version control, and apply the migrations as part of the deployment process. See
        <a href="https://flywaydb.org/" target="_blank">Flyway</a> and
        <a href="https://www.liquibase.org/" target="_blank">Liquibase</a>.

  items:
    - title: Choose between a Monolith and Microservices
      description: |
        Ignore the hype and stick with a monolithic architecture as long as you possibly can. Microservices have a
        massive costs (operational overhead, performance overhead, more failure modes, loss of
        transactions/atomicity/consistency, difficulty in making global changes, backwards compatibility requirements),
        so only use them when your company grows large enough that you can't live without one of the benefits they
        provide (support for different technologies, support for teams working more independently from each other). See
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-czp0Y4Z36Y" target="_blank">Don't Build a Distributed Monolith</a>,
        <a href="https://blog.rapid7.com/2016/09/15/microservices-please-dont/" target="_blank">Microservices — please, don't</a>, and
        <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html" target="_blank">Microservice trade-offs</a> for more info.

    - title: Configure service discovery
      description: |
        If you do go with microservices, one of the problems you'll need to solve is how services can discover the IPs
        and ports of other services they depend on. Some of the solutions you can use include
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/" target="_blank">Load Balancers</a>,
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ecs-service-discovery/" target="_blank">ECS Service Discovery</a>, and
        <a href="https://www.consul.io/" target="_blank">Consul</a>.

    - title: Use multiple Instances
      description: |
        Always run more than one copy (i.e., more than one EC2 Instance or Docker container) of each stateless
        application. This allows you to tolerate the app crashing, allows you to scale the number of copies up and
        down in response to load, and makes it possible to do zero-downtime deployments.

    - title: Use multiple Availability Zones
      description: |
        Configure your <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html" target="_blank">Auto Scaling Groups</a>
        and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/" target="_blank">Load Balancers</a> to make use of all
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html" target="_blank">Availability Zones (AZs)</a>
        in your AWS account so you can tolerate the failure of an entire AZ.

    - title: Set up load balancing
      description: |
        Distribute load across your apps and Availability Zones using Amazon's managed
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/" target="_blank">Load Balancers</a>, which are designed
        for high availability and scalability. Use the
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html" target="_blank">Application Load Balancer (ALB)</a>
        for all HTTP/HTTPS traffic and the
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html" target="_blank">Network Load Balancer (NLB)</a>
        for everything else.

    - title: Use Auto Scaling
      description: |
        Use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/" target="_blank">auto scaling</a> to automatically scale the
        number of resources you're using up to handle higher load and down to save money when load is lower.

    - title: Configure Auto Recovery
      description: |
        Configure a process supervisor such as <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd" target="_blank">systemd</a>
        or <a href="http://supervisord.org/" target="_blank">supervisord</a> to automatically restart failed processes.
        Configure your <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html" target="_blank">Auto Scaling Groups</a>
        to use a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/" target="_blank">Load Balancer</a> for health
        checks and to automatically replace failed EC2 Instances. Use your Docker orchestration tool to monitor the
        health of your Docker containers and automatically restart failed ones (e.g.,
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_HealthCheck.html" target="_blank">ECS Health Checks</a>).

    - title: Configure graceful degradation
      description: |
        Handle failures in your dependencies (e.g., a service not responding) by using
        <a href="https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/994138694582812672" target="_blank">graceful degradation patterns</a>,
        such as retries (with exponential backoff and jitter), circuit breaking, timeouts, deadlines, and rate limiting.

    - title: Perform load tests and use chaos engineering
      description: |
        Run load tests against your infrastructure to figure out when it falls over and what the bottlenecks are. Use
        <a href="https://principlesofchaos.org/" target="_blank">chaos engineering</a> to continuously test the
        resilience of your infrastructure (see also
        <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey" target="_blank">chaos monkey</a>).

  items:
    - title: Pick a Version Control System
      description: |
        Check all code into a Version Control System (VCS). The most popular choice these days is
        <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>. You can use
        <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/" target="_blank">GitLab</a>,
        or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">BitBucket</a> to host your Git repo.

    - title: Do code reviews
      description: |
        Set up a code review process in your team to ensure all commits are reviewed.
        <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/" target="_blank">Pull requests</a> are an easy
        way to do this.

    - title: Configure a build system
      description: |
        Set up a build system for your project, such as <a href="https://gradle.org/" target="_blank">Gradle</a> (for
        Java), <a href="https://github.com/ruby/rake" target="_blank">Rake</a> (for Ruby), or
        <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/" target="_blank">Yarn</a> (for Node.js). The build system is responsible for
        compiling your app, as well as many other tasks described below.

    - title: Use dependency management
      description: |
        Your build systems should allow you to explicitly define all the of the dependencies for your apps. Each
        dependency should be versioned, and ideally, the versions of all dependencies, including transitive
        dependencies, are captured in a lock file.

    - title: Configure static analysis
      description: |
        Configure your build system so it can run
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tools_for_static_code_analysis" target="_blank">static analysis tools</a>
        on your code, such as linters and code coverage.

    - title: Set up automatic code formatting
      description: |
        Configure your build system to automatically format the code according to a well-defined style (e.g., with Go,
        you can run <code>go fmt</code>; with Terraform, you can run <code>terraform fmt</code>). This way, all your
        code has a consistent style, and your team doesn't have to spend any time arguing about tabs vs spaces or curly
        brace placement.

    - title: Set up automated tests
      description: |
        Configure your build system so it can run automated tests on your code, with tools such as
        <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/" target="_blank">JUnit</a> (for Java),
        <a href="http://rspec.info/" target="_blank">RSpec</a> (for Ruby), or
        <a href="https://mochajs.org/" target="_blank">Mocha</a> (for Node.js).

    - title: Publish versioned artifacts
      description: |
        Configure your build system so it can package your app into a deployable "artifact," such as an AMI or Docker
        image. Each artifact should be immutable and have a unique version number that makes it easy to figure out
        where it came from (e.g., tag Docker images with the Git commit ID). Push the artifact to an artifact
        repository (e.g., ECR for Docker images) form which it can be deployed.

    - title: Set up a build server
      description: |
        Set up a server to automatically run builds, static analysis, automated tests, etc. after every commit. You can
        use a hosted system such as <a href="https://circleci.com/" target="_blank">CircleCI</a> or
        <a href="https://travis-ci.org/" target="_blank">Travis CI</a>, or run your a build server yourself with a tool
        such as <a href="https://jenkins.io/" target="_blank">Jenkins</a>.

  items:
    - title: Create deployment environments
      description: |
        Define separate "environments" such as dev, stage, and prod. Each environment can either be a separate AWS
        account (recommended for larger teams and security-sensitive and compliance use cases) or a separate VPC within
        a single AWS account (recommended only for smaller teams).

    - title: Set up per-environment configuration
      description: |
        Your apps may need different configuration settings in each environment: e.g., different memory settings,
        different features on or off. Define these in config files that get checked into version control (e.g.,
        dev-config.yml, stage-config.yml, prod-config.yml) and packaged with your app artifact (i.e., packaged directly
        into the Docker image for your app), and have your app boot up code pick the proper config file for the current
        environment during boot.

    - title: Define your infrastructure as code
      description: |
        Do not deploy anything by hand, by using the AWS Console, or the AWS CLI. Instead, define all of your
        <a href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-terraform-b3d32832baca" target="_blank">infrastructure as code</a>
        using tools such as <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a>,
        <a href="https://www.packer.io/" target="_blank">Packer</a>, and
        <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a>.

    - title: Test your infrastructure code
      description: |
        If all of your infrastructure is defined as code, you can create automated tests for it. The goal is to verify
        your infrastructure works as expected after every single commit, long before those infrastructure changes
        affect prod. See <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest" target="_blank">Terratest</a> for more
        info.

    - title: Set up immutable infrastructure
      description: |
        Don't update EC2 Instance or Docker containers in place. Instead, launch completely new EC2 Instances and new
        Docker containers and, once those are up and healthy, remove the old EC2 Instances and Docker images. Since we
        never "modify" anything, but simply replace, this is known as
        <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/an-introduction-to-immutable-infrastructure" target="_blank">immutable infrastructure</a>,
        and it makes it easier to reason about what's deployed and to manage that infrastructure.

    - title: Promote artifacts
      description: |
        Deploy immutable artifacts to one environment at a time, and promote it to the next environment after testing.
        For example, you might deploy v0.3.2 to dev, and test it there. If it works well, you promote the exact same
        artifact, v0.3.2, to stage, and test it there. If all goes well, you finally promote v0.3.2 to prod. Since it's
        the exact same code in every environment, there's a good chance that if it works in one environment, it'll
        also work in the others.

    - title: Roll back in case of failure
      description: |
        If you use immutable, versioned artifacts as your unit of deployment, then any time something goes wrong, you
        have the option to roll back to a known-good state by rolling out the previous version. If your infrastructure
        is defined as code, you can also see what changed between versions by looking at the diffs in version control.

    - title: Automate your deployments
      description: |
        One of the advantages of defining your entire infrastructure as code is that you can fully automate the
        deployment process, making deployments faster, more reliable, and less stressful.

    - title: Do zero-downtime deployments
      description: |
        There are several strategies you can use for Zero-downtime deployments, such as
        <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html" target="_blank">blue-green deployment</a>
        (works best for stateless apps) or
        <a href="http://hintcafe.net/post/56948449558/rolling-deployment-with-no-downtime" target="_blank">rolling deployment</a>
        (works best for stateful apps).

    - title: Use canary deployments
      description: |
        Instead of deploying the new version of your code to all servers, and risking a bug affecting all users at
        once, you limit the possible damage by first deploying te new code to a single "canary" server. You then
        compare the canary to a "control" server running the old code and make sure there are no unexpected errors,
        performance issues, or other problems. If the canary looks healthy, roll out the new version of your code to
        the rest of the servers. If not, roll back the canary.

    - title: Use feature toggles
      description: |
        Wrap all new functionality in an if-statement that only evaluates to true if a the
        <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html" target="_blank">feature toggle</a> is enabled.
        By default, all feature toggles are disabled, so you can safely check in and even deploy code that isn't
        completely finished (as long as it compiles!), and it won't affect any user. When the feature is done, you can
        use a UI to gradually enable the feature toggle for specific users: e.g., initially just for your company's
        employees, then for 1% of all users, then 10% of all users, and so on. At any stage, if anything goes wrong,
        you can turn the feature toggle off again. Feature toggles allow you to separate <em>deployment</em> of new
        code from the <em>release</em> of new features in that code. They also allow you to do
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing" target="_blank">bucket testing</a>. See

    - title: Set up VPCs
      description: |
        Don't use the Default VPC, as everything in it is publicly accessible by default. Instead, create one or more
        custom <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/" target="_blank">Virtual Private Clouds (VPC)</a>, each with their
        own IP address range (see
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html#VPC_Sizing" target="_blank">VPC and subnet sizing</a>),
        and deploy all of your apps into those VPCs.

    - title: Set up subnets
      description: |
        Create three "tiers" of
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html" target="_blank">subnets</a>
        in each VPC: public, private-app, private-persistence. The public subnets are directly accessible from the
        public Internet and should only be used for a small number of highly locked down, user-facing services, such as
        load balancers and Bastion Hosts. The private-apps subnets are only accessible from within the VPC from the
        public subnets and should be used to run your apps (Auto Scaling Groups, Docker containers, etc.). The
        private-persistence subnets are also only accessible from within the VPC from the private-app subnets (but NOT
        the public subnets) and should be used to run all your data stores (RDS, ElastiCache, etc.). See
        <a href="https://www.whaletech.co/2014/10/02/reference-vpc-architecture.html" target="_blank">A Reference VPC Architecture</a>.

    - title: Configure Network ACLs
      description: |
        Create <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_ACLs.html" target="_blank">Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)</a>
        to control what traffic can go between different subnets. We recommend allowing the public subnets to receive
        traffic from anywhere, the private-app subnets to only receive traffic from the public subnets, and the
        private-persistence subnets to only receive traffic from the private-app subnets.

    - title: Configure Security Groups
      description: |
        Every AWS resource (e.g., EC2 Instances, Load Balancers, RDS DBs, etc.) has a
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html" target="_blank">Security Group</a>
        that acts as a firewall, controlling what traffic is allowed in and out of that resource. By default, no
        traffic is allowed in or out. Follow the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege" target="_blank">Principle of Least Privilege</a>
        and open up the absolute minimum number of ports you can for each resource. When opening up a port, you can
        also specify either the CIDR block (IP address range) or ID of another Security Group that are allowed to
        access that port. Reduce these to solely trusted servers where possible. For example, EC2 Instances should only
        allow SSH access (port 22) from the Security Group of a single, locked-down, trusted server (the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host" target="_blank">Bastion Host</a>).

    - title: Configure Static IPs
      description: |
        By default, all AWS resources (e.g., EC2 Instances, Load Balancers, RDS DBs, etc.) have dynamic IP addresses
        that could change over time (e.g., after a redeploy). When possible, use
        <a href="#architecture-scalability-high-availability-service-discovery">Service Discovery</a> to find
        the IPs of services you depend on. If that's not possible, you can create static IP addresses that can be
        attached and detached from resources using
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html" target="_blank">Elastic IP Addresses (EIPs)</a>
        for public IPs or
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html" target="_blank">Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)</a>
        for private IPs.

    - title: Configure DNS using Route 53
      description: |
        Manage DNS entries using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/" target="_blank">Route 53</a>. You can buy
        public domain names using the
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar.html" target="_blank">Route 53 Registrar</a>
        or create custom private domain names, accessible only from within your VPC, using

    - title: Configure encryption in transit
      description: |
        Encrypt all network connections using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" target="_blank">TLS</a>.
        Many AWS services support TLS connections by default (e.g., RDS) or if you enable them (e.g., ElastiCache).
        You can get free, auto-renewing TLS certificates for your public domain names from
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/" target="_blank">AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)</a>. You
        can also use the
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/private-certificate-authority/" target="_blank">ACM Private Certificate Authority</a>
        to get auto-renewing TLS certificates for private domain names within your VPC.

    - title: Configure encryption at rest
      description: |
        Encrypt the root volume of each EC2 Instance by using the
        <a href="https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/amazon-ebs.html#encrypt_boot" target="_blank">encrypt_boot</a>
        setting in Packer. Enable encryption for each
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html" target="_blank">EBS Volume</a>
        too. Many AWS services optionally support disk encryption: e.g., see
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html" target="_blank">Encrypting Amazon RDS Resources</a>
        and
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/at-rest-encryption.html" target="_blank">ElastiCache for Redis At-Rest Encryption</a>.

    - title: Set up SSH access
      description: |
        Do NOT share <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html" target="_blank">EC2 KeyPairs</a>
        with your team! Otherwise, everyone will be using the same username and key for server acesss (so there's no
        audit trail), the key may easily be compromised, and if it is, or someone leaves the company, you'll have to
        redeploy ALL your EC2 Instances to change the KeyPair. Instead, configure your EC2 Instances so that each
        developer can use their own username and SSH key, and if that developer leaves the company, the key can be
        invalidated immediately (see the
        <a href="https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/" target="_blank">Gruntwork Library</a> for
        solutions).

    - title: Deploy a Bastion Host
      description: |
        All EC2 Instances should be in a private subnet and NOT accessible directly from the public Internet. Only a
        single, locked-down EC2 Instance, known as the Bastion Host, should run in the public subnets. You must first
        connect to the Bastion Host, which gets you "in" to the network, and then you can use it as a "jump host" to
        connect to the other EC2 Instances.

    - title: Deploy a VPN Server
      description: |
        We typically recommend running a VPN Server as the entrypoint to your network (as the Bastion Host).
        <a href="https://openvpn.net/" target="_blank">OpenVPN</a> is the most popular option for running a VPN server.

    - title: Set up a secrets management solution
      description: |
        NEVER store secrets in plaintext. Developers should store their secrets in a secure secrets manager, such as
        <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/" target="_blank">pass</a>,
        <a href="https://1password.com/" target="_blank">1Password</a>, or
        <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/" target="_blank">LastPass</a>. Applications should store all their secrets
        (such as DB passwords and API keys) either in files encrypted with
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/" target="_blank">KMS</a> or in a secret store such as
        <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/" target="_blank">Vault</a>.

    - title: Use server hardening practices
      description: |
        Every server should be hardened to protect against attackers. This may include: running
        <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/services/hardened-virtual-images/" target="_blank">CIS Hardened Images</a>,
        <a href="https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">fail2ban</a> to protect against malicious access,

        Join the security advisory mailing lists for any software you use and monitor those lists for announcements of
        critical security vulnerabilities.

    - title: Create IAM Users
      description: |
        Create an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html" target="_blank">IAM User</a>
        for each developer. The developer will have a web console login for accessing AWS from a web browser and a set
        of API keys for accessing AWS from the CLI. Note that the
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html" target="_blank">root user</a>
        on your AWS account should only be used to create an initial admin IAM User; after that, do all your work from
        that IAM user account and never use the root user account again!

    - title: Create IAM Groups
      description: |
        Manage permissions for IAM users using
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.html" target="_blank">IAM Groups</a>. Follow
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege" target="_blank">Principle of Least Privilege</a>,
        assigning the minimum permissions possible to each IAM Group and User.

    - title: Create IAM Roles
      description: |
        Give your AWS resources (e.g., EC2 Instances, Lambda Functions) access to other resources by attacing
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html" target="_blank">IAM Roles</a>. All
        AWS SDK and CLI tools automatically know how to use IAM Roles, so you should never have to copy AWS access keys
        to a server.

    - title: Create cross-account IAM Roles
      description: |
        If you are using multiple AWS accounts (e.g., one for dev and one for prod), you should define all of the IAM
        Users in one account, and use
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html" target="_blank">IAM Roles</a>
        to provide access to the other AWS accounts. This way, developers have only one set of credentials to manage,
        and you can have very fine-grained permissions control over what IAM Users can do in any given account.

    - title: Create a password policy and enforce MFA
      description: |
        Set a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_passwords_account-policy.html" target="_blank">password policy<a>
        that requires a long password for all IAM users and require every user to enable
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa/" target="_blank">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</a>.

    - title: Record audit Logs
