  title: Update Terms of Service to clean up and professionalize terms
  description:
    We removed DevOps Bootcamps and Gruntwork Professional Services since we are no longer offering these services. While we have always required that you agree to an annual subscription, we’ve cleaned up a few legal provisions around billing practices and termination rights to make this crystal clear. We also clarified that the authorized users of your affiliated companies can use the services. In addition, we’ve put into writing our current policies and cleaned up a few legal positions around; <ul class="small">
    <li>how we expect both you and us to behave when you use our website (see our <a href="/website-terms/" title="Website Terms">Site Terms</a>);</li>
    <li>how we use your data to help provide the services to you (see our updated <a href="/legal/privacy-policy/" title="Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a>);</li>
    <li>how we use your anonymized data to improve the services;</li>
    <li>what we do to keep your data private and secure (see our updated <a href="/legal/privacy-policy/" title="Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a> and, for our European Union customers, our recently added <a href="/legal/dpa/" title="Data Processing Agreement">Data Processing Agreement</a>);</li>
    <li>the fact that we can’t control third-party websites, services and products, and when you use them through our services you should check their terms and conditions;</li>
    <li>how we use (see our <a href="/open-source-policy" title="Open source policy">Open Source Usage Policy</a>);</li>
    <li> specific corrective steps we will take if someone claims they own part of the services and we did not have their permission to use it;</li>
    <li>when we need to defend and cover you if something goes wrong and it’s our fault; and, similarly, when we you need to defend and cover us - if something goes wrong and it’s your fault;</li>
    <li> our expectation that if something goes wrong between us and we can’t resolve the issue even after trying our best, you will need to come to where we are in Maricopa County, Arizona to sue us (and the local laws in Arizona will apply); and</li>
    <li>a few minor legal positions around minimum age; deposits, billing and taxes; and export control.</li></ul>

  title: Update definition of an Authorized User
  description: We updated the definition of an Authorized User to more accurately reflect our concept of "access." In our current thinking, an Authorized User is someone who either directly accesses the code by reading or executing it on their local computer, or someone who indirectly accesses the code by triggering a process that reads or executes the code. We do not see this as a material expansion of the definition of an Authorized User from our original definition, only a more precise clarification.

  title: Removed our security alerts service
  description: Prior to this change, we emailed customers about critical security vulnerabilities. But since we began offering this service, many third parties have emerged that provide a better version of this functionality (in many cases at no cost), and customers have told us they do not receive much value from our notifications. For these reasons, we are removing this from our offering.
