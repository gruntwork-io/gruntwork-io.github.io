  - title: Server hardening
    description: |
      Configure every server to run fail2ban and to automatically install critical security patches on a nightly basis.

  - title: SSH management
    description: |
      Install ssh-grunt on every server, which allows admins to grant or revoke SSH access using your identity provider
      (e.g., IAM, Google, Active Directory) and for each developer to be able to use their own username and SSH key to
      connect to servers.

  - title: Secrets management
    description: |
      Use Secrets Manager to securely encrypt and decrypt application secrets, such as database passwords.

  - title: Resource configuration
    description: |
      Enable AWS Config with a best practices set of Config Rules to monitor for anomalous behavior.

design:
  - title: High Availability
    description: |
      All aspects of the architecture are designed for high availability: e.g., all servers are deployed across multiple
      Availability Zones; load balancers perform health checks and automatically replace failed servers; the load
      balancers themselves run multiple servers and do automatic failover; the database and cache can also do automatic
      failover to standby servers in another Availability Zone; data is automatically backed up on a nightly basis.

  - title: Scalability
    description: |
      All aspects of the architecture support easy vertical and horizontal scalability: auto scaling policies
      resize the server cluster in response to load; the load balancers will automatically scale up and down
      in response to load; you can configure read replicas for your database and cache clusters.

  - title: Infrastructure as code
    description: |
      You get 100% of the source code for everything in the Reference Architecture. It is written using a variety of
      tools, including Terragrunt, Terraform, Packer, Docker, Go, Python, and Bash.

  - title: Built for teams
    description: |
      With Gruntwork Pipelines, every change is centralized, peer-reviewed, and audited, all using code. Use the pipeline
      for your infrastructure <i>and</i> application deployments!
