- title: We build your architecture
  description: |
    <p>
      We generate the architecture using Terragrunt, Terraform, Bash, Python and Go. We deploy the resources to your
      AWS accounts. We validate the configuration, then we push the code to your git repository. For AWS, this
      takes about a day.
    </p>

- title: Learn how to use it
  description: |
    <p>
      Use our <a href="/training/">DevOps Training Library</a> to learn how to use your new architecture with a series of
      micro-videos that do an in-depth walkthrough of all the most common uses cases. Need to learn Terraform, Docker,
      or Packer? We have courses on those, too!
