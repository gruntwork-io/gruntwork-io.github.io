- title: You need to run your infrastructure on AWS or GCP
  description: |
    You're launching a new app. You're migrating to the cloud. You're going through a DevOps transformation. And
    this time, you're going to "do it right." But there's a problem. Actually, 1,001 problems: you need to figure out how to
    run app servers, databases, load balancers, CDNs, continuous integration, automated deployment, monitoring, alerting,
    log aggregation, secrets management, SSH access, VPN access, DNS, TLS, and so on. And you just don't have the time or
    expertise to do it all.

- title: Try out the Infrastructure as Code library
  description: |
    Fortunately, there's a solution: the Gruntwork <a href="/static/infrastructure-as-code-library/">Infrastructure as Code Library</a>
    (IaC Library) is a collection of reusable infrastructure code written in Terraform, Go, Bash, and Python that
    solves these 1,001 problems. Instead of reinventing the wheel, you can leverage 3+ years and 300,000+ lines of
    battle-tested code, including pre-built solutions for Kubernetes, MySQL, Postgres, Redis, OpenVPN, Jenkins, Lambda,
    CloudWatch, Kafka, ELK, Vault, Consul, and more, all of which has been proven in production at
    <a href="/static/customers/">hundreds of companies</a>. To get an idea of how the library works before signing up, try out
    our <a href="/static/infrastructure-as-code-library/#open-source">open source modules</a> and check out
    <a href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/5-lessons-learned-from-writing-over-300-000-lines-of-infrastructure-code-36ba7fadeac1" title="5 Lessons Learned From Writing Over 300,000 Lines of Infrastructure Code" target="_blank">5 Lessons Learned From Writing Over 300,000 Lines of Infrastructure Code</a>.
    And if you sign up and you're not happy for any reason, we'll refund your money within the first 30 days.

- title: Deploy an end-to-end architecture
  description: |
    You can assemble all the code from the IaC Library yourself by following our
    <a href="/static/guides">Production Deployment Guides</a>, or you can have the Gruntwork team assemble a
    <a href="/static/reference-architecture/">Reference Architecture</a> for you. The Reference Architecture is an opinionated,
    battle-tested, end-to-end tech stack that includes just about everything you need, including: server cluster, load
    balancer, database, cache, network topology, monitoring, alerting, CI/CD, secrets management, VPN, and more. We
    customize the Reference Architecture to your needs, give you 100% of the code, and deploy it into your AWS account
    (in about one day) or GCP account (contact us!).

- title: Learn Terraform, Docker, Packer, AWS, GCP, and DevOps
  description: |
    Gruntwork Subscribers also get access to the <a href="/static/training/">DevOps Training Library</a>, which
    is a collection of video courses that teach you everything you need to know to use the Iac Library and Reference
    Architecture, including Terraform, Docker, Packer, AWS, GCP, security, scalability, high availability, and more.

- title: Get ongoing maintenance and updates
  description: |
    At Gruntwork, we provide ongoing maintenance and updates for all the code in the IaC Library and Reference
    Architecture. We regularly add new modules and every time Terraform comes out with a new version, AWS or GCP release new services, or a security vulnerability
    is announced, we update our code, release a new version, and announce it in our
    <a href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/tagged/gruntwork-newsletter" target="_blank">newsletter</a>. As a Subscriber,
    you get better infrastructure just by bumping a version number in your code!

- title: Get expert support
  description: |
    Gruntwork also provides commercial support for the IaC Library and Reference Architecture. Every time you have a
    question, need help troubleshooting, or want design feedback, you can reach out to us via our community Slack
    channel, a private, shared Slack channel, email, or phone/video calls.
