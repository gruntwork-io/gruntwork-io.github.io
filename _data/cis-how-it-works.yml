      Read the <a href="http://gruntwork.io/guides/compliance/how-to-achieve-cis-benchmark-compliance/">How to achieve
      compliance with the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark</a> guide to get a handle on the concepts and process.

- title: Use the compliance modules
  description: |
    <p>
      Use the compliance modules to configure your account according to the recommendations in the Benchmark:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create compliant IAM users, groups, roles, and policies</li>
      <li>Require multi-factor authentication for accessing AWS</li>
      <li>Enable AWS Config across all regions</li>
      <li>Remove default VPCs and unnecessary default security groups</li>
      <li>Configure CloudTrail integration with S3, KMS, and CloudWatch Logs</li>
      <li>Establish metrics and alarms for compliance violations</li>
      <li>Configure VPCs with flow logs and a minimal set of peering connections</li>
      <li>Avoid overly permissive inbound security group rules</li>
    </ul>

- title: Pass an audit

    <p>
      After using the modules to configure your AWS accounts, your infrastructure will pass muster with the CIS audit steps. Take a bow after your security team inspects your account for compliance.
    </p>

- title: Stay current

    <p>
      Our tests ensure that the modules remain compliant over time. We'll update the modules when new versions of the Benchmark are released, and the updates are included with the subscription.
