  items:
    - title:
      ans: |
        <p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your personal data. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Where the use of your information is necessary for the performance of a contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you;</li>

        <p>We may store and process any information that we collect (personal or otherwise) ourselves or in databases and servers owned and maintained by us, our affiliates, agents, or service providers, including without limitation in a Gruntwork-owned AWS account. If you access or use the Services outside of the United States, information that we collect about you may be transferred to servers inside the United States, or in any country where we have operations or where we engage vendors or service providers. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you originally provided the data. By using the Services, or submitting your personal data to us, you consent to such transfer and processing of your such information. We may also store some information locally on your computer or other devices. For example, we may store information as local cache so that you can open the Website and view content faster.</p>
        <p>Where personal data is transferred outside the European Economic Area to a third party in a country that is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, data is appropriately protected by Standard Contractual Clauses, an appropriate Privacy Shield certification, or a vendor’s Processor Binding Corporate Rules.

          <br />
          <li><strong>Data Requests.</strong> Certain privacy laws, including the GDPR and the CCPA provide users with rights related to their personal data. Depending on your location, you may be eligible for a number of rights with respect to your information. 
            <br /><br />
            <ul>
              <li><i>Right to Access & Portability:</i> You may be able to access certain personal data associated with your account by visiting your account settings.

              <br />
              <li><i>Right to Correction:</i> You have the right to request that we correct information about you. By visiting your account settings, you can correct and change certain personal data associated with your account. </li>
              <br />

              <li><i>Right to Object:</i> If we process your personal data based on our legitimate interests as explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will stop processing your personal data unless we have a compelling legitimate ground to continue processing or where it is legally necessary. </li>
              <br />
              <li><i>Right to Withdraw Consent:</i> Where we rely on consent, you can withdraw your consent to our processing by using various means we offer such as an email unsubscribe link or your account settings. This is without prejudice to your right to permanently close your account and delete your personal data.               </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>The CCPA provides California residents with the following additional rights: </p>

              <br />
              <li><i>Right to Opt-Out:</i> To the extent that Gruntwork “sells” personal data (as that term is defined under the CCPA), California residents are entitled to opt-out of the “sale” of data at any time (see below for more information).             </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>Limiting use of, or deleting, your personal data may affect features and uses that rely on that information. However, we will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights, including otherwise denying you goods or services, providing you with a different level or quality of services, or charging you different prices or rates for services.</p>
            <p>We will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law. Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation. Before responding to your request, we may require that you provide us with additional information to confirm your identity. You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. In order to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid government-issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid government-issued identification. We may verify the authenticity of the request directly with you. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the authorities applicable to your situation. However, we invite you to contact us with any concern, as we would be happy to try to resolve it directly. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additional Disclosures for California Residents</p>
        <p><u>Notice of Collection:</u> In addition to the rights and choices described above, the CCPA requires disclosure of the categories of personal data collected over the past 12 months. While this information is provided in greater detail in the “What information do we collect about you?” section above, the categories of personal data that we have collected – as described by the CCPA – are: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identifiers, including name, email address, IP address, and mobile device ID. </li>
          <br />
          <li>Other individual records, such as phone number, billing address, or credit or debit card information. This category includes personal data protected under Cal. Civ. Code 1798.80e and overlaps with other categories listed here. </li>
          <br />
          <li>Commercial information, including subscriptions and engagement with the Services. </li>
          <br />
          <li>Employment information, including company name and job title. </li>
          <br />
          <li>Geolocaton data, including general location data derived from IP addresses and location-enabled services such as WiFi. </li>
          <br />
          <li>Inferences, including information about your interests and preferences. </li>
          <br />

        <p><u>The Purposes for Our Collection:</u> We collect and use these categories of personal data for our business and commercial purposes described in the “How do we use your information” section above, including providing and improving the Services, maintaining the safety and security of the Services, and for advertising and marketing our business. </p>
        <p><u>Third-Party Marketing and Your Rights (Opt-Out of “Sale”):</u> Gruntwork does not sell personal data to third parties for monetary value. However, the term “sale” is defined broadly in the CCPA. To the extent that “sale” under the CCPA is interpreted to include interest-based advertising or other data uses described in the “How do we use your information” section above, we will comply with applicable law with respect to those uses.</p>
        <br />
        <p><u>“Do Not Track” Signals:</u> We do not recognize or respond to any web browser-initiated “Do Not Track” signals. At present, no universally accepted standard exists on how companies should respond to “Do Not Track” signals. In the event a universally accepted standard is established, we will assess and provide an appropriate response to these signals. If you wish, you can configure most browsers to reject cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you a chance to decide whether or not to accept it. Consult the help section of your browser to learn more about how to do this. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of the Services. </p>
        <br />
        <p><u>Shine The Light:</u> California Civil Code §1798.83 permits users of the Website who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Gruntwork does not share personal data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.         </p>
