This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we may collect from and about you when you visit our website located at <a href="https://gruntwork.io/">www.gruntwork.io</a> (the “Site”); use the Gruntwork services, including our cloud-based developer portal located at <a href="https://app.gruntwork.io">app.gruntwork.io</a> (“the Portal”) and any additional Gruntwork-branded features and functionalities, websites, user interfaces, and applications (collectively with the Portal, the “Services”); engage with us through our newsletters, emails, and branded social media accounts; or otherwise interact with us. It also describes our practices for using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information as well as certain legal rights you may have, subject to applicable law, and how you can exercise them.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Where the use of your information is necessary for the performance of a contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you;</li>

        <p>We may store and process any information that we collect (personal or otherwise) ourselves or in databases and servers owned and maintained by us, our affiliates, agents, or service providers, including without limitation in a Gruntwork-owned AWS account. If you access or use the Services outside of the United States, information that we collect about you may be transferred to servers inside the United States, or in any country where we have operations or where we engage vendors or service providers. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you originally provided the data. By using the Services, or submitting your personal data to us, you consent to such transfer and processing of your such information. If you reside or are located in the European Economic Area ("EEA") and such transfers occur, we take appropriate steps to provide the same level of protection for the processing carried out in any such countries as you would have within the EEA to the extent feasible under applicable law. You may contact us at privacy@gruntwork.io to request a copy of the relevant mechanism we use to transfer personal data outside the EEA.</p>

            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>Limiting use of, or deleting, your personal data may affect features and uses that rely on that information.

            <p>We will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law. Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation. Before responding to your request, we may require that you provide us with additional information to confirm your identity. You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. In order to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid government-issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid government-issued identification. We may verify the authenticity of the request directly with you. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the authorities applicable to your situation. However, we invite you to contact us with any concern, as we would be happy to try to resolve it directly. </p>

        <h3>Additional Disclosures for California Residents</h3>
        <p><u>Notice of Collection:</u> In addition to the rights and choices described above, the CCPA requires disclosure of the categories of personal data collected over the past 12 months.
