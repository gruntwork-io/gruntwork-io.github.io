- title: Setup a Terraform pipeline based on best practices
  description: |
    Gruntwork engineers carefully designed a Terraform pipeline code framework and approach based on best practices for workflow, long-term infrastructure code maintainability, and security. Adopt those best practices for your own Terraform team.

- title: Adopt a security-first approach
  description: It's all too common to give your CI server admin-level permissions needed to launch arbitrary infrastructure, a dangerous security posture. Gruntwork Pipelines enables a secure infrastructure pipeline by granting the key permissions to a Fargate Task that exposes a limited, locked down interface and only allows running pre-defined commands such as <code>terraform apply</code> in pre-defined git repos/branches/folders that require peer review to change.

- title: Run your pipeline on any CI tool
  description: Run Gruntwork pipelines on any CI tool you want, including both managed and self-hosted varieties. There's no need to setup a new tool, or share sensitive cloud credentials with another third party.
