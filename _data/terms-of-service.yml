        <p><strong>2.1. Definition.</strong> An “Authorized User” shall mean your employee or contractor who is granted per-user access rights to the Services, and shall include accounts with such access rights used primarily for performing automated tasks (commonly called “machine users”). You are entitled to up to the maximum number of Authorized Users specified at the time of purchase.

    - title: 4. Compensation and Invoicing
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>4.1. Pricing.</strong> In consideration for the Services, you will pay Gruntwork as provided in the applicable terms for the specific Services you have chosen to subscribe to. The price you pay for specific Services will be the prices as published on our Website at the time you first register for the Services, which will remain your prices throughout the term of this Agreement (including any renewal periods).  Gruntwork is free to change the pricing of the Services at any time during the term of this Agreement, but the new pricing shall only apply to you for any renewal period if you notify Gruntwork before the beginning of such renewal period of your request for the new pricing.</p>
        <p><strong>4.2. Incidental Expenses.</strong> If performing the Services involves incidental expenses, you will only be responsible for such incidental expenses if you previously approved the expenses in writing (email is sufficient).</p>
      plain:  |
        All our pricing is published at <a target="_blank" rel="internal" href="/pricing" title="Gruntwork Pricing">https://gruntwork.io/pricing</a>, and we don't charge any hidden fees. We won't change the price you pay for our services unless:<br />(1) we announce new pricing, AND<br  />(2) you ask us to apply the new pricing to your next renewal period.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>4.3. Billing for Subscription Services.</strong> Unless the terms for a specific subscription-based Service expressly provides otherwise for that particular Service, when you first sign up for the Services, Gruntwork will automatically charge you a $500 initial deposit, and Gruntwork will review your order for Services and approve or reject your order.  Once Gruntwork has approved your order, on the approval date, Gruntwork will automatically charge you the subscription fees owed for the upcoming month of Services, and then will charge you the subscription fees owed for each subsequent month on the earlier of (a) the same day of each subsequent month or (b) the last day of such subsequent month. This payment shall be made by credit card.</p>
        <p><strong>4.4. Billing for Non-Subscription Services.</strong> For any payments you owe other than monthly subscription fees, including approved incidental expenses, Gruntwork will charge your credit card, unless the payment is for more than $5,000, in which case we will invoice you, and you will make payment on such invoice via check, ACH or wire transfer within 15 days of your receipt of the invoice.</p>
      plain:  |
        When you submit your order, we'll immediately charge you a $500 initial deposit, regardless of the services you ordered. Soon after, a Grunt will review your order, and once it's approved, we'll charge your credit card any remaining amounts you owe for your first month of service.<br /><br /> Going forward, we'll bill you automatically by credit card on the same day of the month that we approved your order.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>4.5. Late Payments.</strong> Late payments will be subject to a 1.5% fee per month, or the highest amount permitted by law, whichever is lower. You will pay for all costs incurred in the collection of past-due amounts owed to Gruntwork, including any legal fees.</p>
      plain:  |
        If you're late with your payments, you'll owe us a late fee and have to cover our costs of collecting from you.

    - title: 5. Term and Termination
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>5.1. Master Terms.</strong> These Terms apply to you so long as you use any of the Services, and will continue until terminated pursuant to this section 5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the termination of these Terms does not result in the termination of the terms of service applicable to specific Services. Each of the terms of service applicable to specific Services is subject to its own term as set forth in those terms of service, and these Terms shall continue to apply for specific Services until the terms of service for those specific Services terminates.</p>
      plain:  |
        We have "master terms" that cover all our products and service, plus each product or service has its own additional terms. You can cancel individual products or services without canceling other products or services or these master terms.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>5.2. Termination for Convenience.</strong> Either Gruntwork or you may terminate these Terms at any time by giving 30 days’ written notice to the other of such termination.</p>
        <p><strong>5.3. Termination for Breach.</strong> Either Gruntwork or you may also terminate these Terms at any time upon the material breach of these Terms by the other Party with at least 14 days' prior written notice to the other Party, provided that the material breach has not been cured prior to the end of the notice period. Any such termination must clearly identify these Terms.</p>
        <p><strong>5.4. Upon Termination</strong> In the event of termination of these Terms by Client, Gruntwork will be due full compensation for all Services performed through the termination date (including approved expenses) within 15 days of the termination date. You and Gruntwork each reserve all rights, including all intellectual property rights or other rights as set out in section 6 below, under these Terms in the event of any such termination.</p>
      plain:  |
        You can terminate these master terms any time with 30 days' notice (or, if we fail to live up to this agreement, with 14 days' notice), but keep in mind that the specific product or service you ordered may have a different term. For example, the Gruntwork Subscription has an annual subscription.<br /><br />If you do terminate, you'll still owe us any amounts you owed us before terminating.

    - title: 6. Intellectual Property Rights
      legalese: |
        <p id="customer-license"><strong>6.1. Customer License.</strong> Subject to the terms of service of the applicable specific Services you have subscribed to, and provided that you pay Gruntwork all amounts owed pursuant to these Terms and such other terms of service and that you are not in breach of any provision of these Terms or such other terms of service, Gruntwork hereby grants to you a royalty-free, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable (other than as specifically set forth in section 15 below), non-sublicensable license for your Authorized Users to use, install, test, execute, perform, and copy the Services exclusively for your business use, and to create derivative works or otherwise modify the Services (including source code of the Services) purely for your own purposes (the “License”).</p>
        <p><strong>6.2. License is Private to Customer.</strong> Gruntwork does not grant you a license, and you acknowledge that you are not permitted to sell, distribute, or publish in any way (under an open source license or otherwise) to any other party without express written permission from Gruntwork, any portion of the Services (including any source code of the Services) or any derivative or modification of the Services created by you, even if Gruntwork otherwise publishes or redistributes (under an open source license or otherwise) the Services or any portion thereof.</p>
        <p><strong>6.3. Limited Rights Transfer.</strong> Gruntwork does not transfer any rights to any portion of the Services to you or any third party, and delivery of any Services to you shall not constitute any transfer of rights, except as set forth in this section 6. Gruntwork retains all rights unless enumerated otherwise herein.</p>
      plain:  |
        You can do anything you want with our code and training as long as only Authorized Users access it and you use it for your company only. In particular, you cannot share our code or training with another company, resell it, publish it as open source, or try to sub-license it.<br /><br />Each person on your team who accesses our code, training, or support must be an Authorized User. For example, we don't allow the use of a single GitHub profile that's shared by multiple individuals.<br /><br />Note that, per <a href="#post-termination-rights">Gruntwork Subscription / Section 1.5</a>, our license allows you to keep using the code even if you cancel! Just make sure that you never directly compete with us (per <a href="#non-compete">section 12</a>).

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>6.4. Gruntwork Retains Ownership.</strong> Gruntwork retains all rights to all works (including source code, object code, user interfaces, documentation, or other works), algorithms, data, inventions, discoveries, ideas, designs, trade secrets, tangible or intangible, embodied in the Services or created or reduced to practice in performance of the Services, including without limitation all copyrights, patent rights, trade secret rights, trademark rights, moral rights, and other intellectual property rights to and in the Services in the United States and all other countries, including the right to pursue patents, utility models, or industrial design applications in the United States and all other countries. No portion of the Services is developed as a “work-made-for-hire”, as defined by the Copyright Law of the United States, for you, and such Services shall be exclusively owned by Gruntwork.</p>
      plain:  |
        We give you a very permissive license to the code, but we remain the official owners of it.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>6.5. Use with Other Customers.</strong> Gruntwork reserves the right to use the Services or any portion thereof for any and all purposes. Gruntwork intends and reserves the right, and you hereby acknowledge Gruntwork’s intent and right, to incorporate the Services or any portion thereof into projects for customers other than you, and, without limitation, to license the Services or any portion thereof to other customers of Gruntwork and to other third parties.</p>
      plain:  |
        We plan to share this code with other customers just like you!

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>6.6. Customer Contributions to Gruntwork.</strong> Nothing in these Terms requires you to contribute to the Services; however, if you choose to contribute any intellectual property via a submission to a Gruntwork source code repository (for example, via a GitHub pull request), Gruntwork will own such contribution (“Gruntwork-Owned Contribution”). You warrant that Gruntwork-Owned Contributions do not include any of your Confidential Information (as defined in section 7), and you hereby assign to Gruntwork all rights in the Gruntwork-Owned Contribution, including without limitation all copyrights, patent rights, trade secret rights, trademark rights, moral rights, and other intellectual property rights to and in the Services in the United States and all other countries, including the right to pursue patents, utility models, or industrial design applications in the United States and all other countries, and will do everything reasonably possible (when requested by Gruntwork, and at Gruntwork’s expense) to carry out in good faith the intent of this clause. Nothing in these Terms requires you to provide access to Gruntwork to your source code repository, unless otherwise expressly required under the terms of service of a specific Service that you have utilized.</p>
        <p><strong>6.7. Private Customer Intellectual Property.</strong> If you create intellectual property and do not contribute it to a Gruntwork source code repository (for example, if you only contribute intellectual property to your own source code repository or to your private fork of a Gruntwork source code repository), you will continue to own such intellectual property (“Customer Intellectual Property”).  Gruntwork shall have no ownership or other rights in Customer Intellectual Property.</p>
      plain:  |
        Anything you do with our code in your own code repos is your intellectual property and we will not have any rights to it.<br /><br />But if you find a bug in our code or see an opportunity for an improvement, you might want to contribute some code back to us. If you do that, we'll want to share that code with all our customers. So if you open a Pull Request on one of our GitHub repos, we'll own the code you submit.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>6.8. Gruntwork Use of Open Source Software.</strong> You acknowledge that Gruntwork may from time-to-time utilize third-party software, such as publicly-distributed software (e.g., third-party software commonly known as “free software” or “open source software” subject to one or more third-party license agreements), or other third-party documentation and information in generating the Services or otherwise providing products or services to you under these Terms. Gruntwork may incorporate such third-party software into the Services or make use of such third-party software in the Services. If the third-party software uses a GPL, LGPL, or MPL license, Gruntwork will ensure the use of that third-party software in the Services does not trigger GPL, LGPL, or MPL obligations commonly referred to as “viral” obligations.</p>
      plain:  |
        Some of the code in our library contains open source tools that use a "copyleft" license like GPL (e.g. <code>curl</code>). We won't modify these tools in such a way that we trigger a "viral" obligation that requires our code (or your derivative works from our cdoe) to be released as GPL.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>6.9. Your Use of Open Source Software.</strong> You also acknowledge that, under the terms of the License granted herein, you agree not to distribute the Services or any derivative of the Services in any way and, as such, acknowledges and agrees that you will not “convey” any Services or derivative of the Services in a manner that would trigger GPL and LGPL obligations commonly referred to as “viral” obligations. In the event that you produce any derivative work from any portion of the Services, or otherwise modify the Services, you shall be solely responsible for ensuring that such derivatives or modifications comply with the terms of the licenses to any third-party software incorporated into the Services.</p>
      plain:  |
        In section 6.8, we make a commitment to you not to modify any open source code to trigger a "viral" obligation.<br /><br />Here, we ask you to do the same. In practice, this means that if you modify our code, you can't modify any GPL code that we distribute with the code. For example, we use <code>curl</code> in many of our bash scripts. If you need to make a change to how we use <code>curl</code>, don't modify <code>curl</code> itself because the GPL license on <code>curl</code> will then require that all the code that uses <code>curl</code> be made GPL as well.<br /><br /><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Don't modify source code written by a third party when you submit a Pull Request to us.

    - title: 7. Confidentiality
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>7.1 Mutual Non-Disclosure.</strong> You and Gruntwork acknowledge that during the course of Gruntwork performing the Services, each Party may disclose information that is confidential and proprietary to such Party, its vendors or its customers (“Confidential Information”) to the other Party to facilitate work under these Terms. You and Gruntwork agree that each of you will hold the other Party’s Confidential Information in confidence. You and Gruntwork agree that each of you will only use the other Party’s Confidential Information as expressly authorized by these Terms, and in the preparation of the Services or in integrating the Services with your other products, and will not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party without the written permission of the Party disclosing the Confidential Information. </p>
      plain:  |
        We won't share any confidential information about you, and you agree not to share any confidential information about us, including our code.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>7.2 Protection of Confidential Information.</strong> Each Party will protect Confidential Information disclosed to it by taking reasonable precautions to avoid disclosure which are at least as restrictive as the precautions it uses to protect its own proprietary information, but in no event less than reasonable care, and will limit access to the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to those of its employees or agents who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein. The foregoing are collectively referred to herein as the “Obligations of Confidentiality.”</p>
      plain:  |
        We'll each treat each other's confidential information at least as carefully as we treat our own.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>7.3. Definition of Confidential Information.</strong> The Obligations of Confidentiality shall apply regardless of the form the Confidential Information takes. To be treated as Confidential Information under this section, written information must be marked as “Confidential Information” in writing at the time of its transmittal. Confidential Information disclosed orally or in any form other than a document must be identified as proprietary at the time of disclosure and then described in a writing, suitably marked as “Confidential Information”, provided to the receiving Party within 30 days of the disclosure. Confidential information will not include information that:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>was already known to the Party to which it is disclosed before its disclosure under these Terms;</li>
          <li>is or becomes publicly known without breach of these Terms;</li>
          <li>is developed by a receiving Party independently without reference to the relevant confidential information of the disclosing Party;</li>
          <li>is obtained from third parties, which have no obligations to keep confidential to the Parties to these Terms.</li>
        </ol>
      plain:  |
        This is a pretty typical definition of Confidential Information, and what's specifically not considered Confidential Information.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>7.4. Mandatory Disclosure.</strong> The Parties may disclose Confidential Information to comply with applicable law or in response to a valid order of requirement by a court or other governmental body, provided that the receiving Party gives the disclosing Party prior written notice of such disclosure in order to permit the disclosing Party to seek an appropriate protective order.</p>
        <p><strong>7.5. Survival of Obligations Upon Termination.</strong> The Obligation of Confidentiality will survive termination of these Terms for three years.</p>
        <p><strong>7.6. Included in Gruntwork Confidential Information.</strong> You agree that the Services and all portions thereof is Confidential Information of Gruntwork unless or until publicly disclosed or publicly distributed by Gruntwork.</p>
      plain:  |
        If a government body tells either of us we have to disclose the other's confidential information, we'll do it, but we'll make sure to update the other party on what happened.

    - title: 8. Limited Liability
      legalese: |
        <p>Gruntwork's total liability to you under these Terms, and all other terms of service for specific Services, for damages, costs, and expenses will not exceed the compensation received by Gruntwork under these Terms for the 12-month period prior to any claim. Gruntwork will not be liable for your lost profits or special, incidental, or consequential damages, whether in an action in contract or tort, even if you have been advised by Gruntwork of the possibility of such damages. You and Gruntwork agree to this limitation even if the remedy for any breach of this contract fails of its essential purpose.</p>

    - title: 9. Indemnifications
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>9.1. Indemnification by You.</strong> You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Gruntwork and its members, employees, and agents from and against any third party liability, claims, demands, damages, judgments, losses and expenses of any nature, including legal expenses and attorney’s fees, arising out of any theory of liability (including tort, warranty, or strict liability) or out of damage to any property, related in any way to your use of the Services or exercise of the rights granted under these Terms except to the extent the claim is subject to Gruntwork’s indemnification obligation set forth in section 9.2.</p>
      plain:  |
        If someone else sues us or has any other claim against us for something that's really your fault and not ours, you'll defend and cover us.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>9.2. Indemnification by Gruntwork.</strong> Gruntwork will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless you and your members, employees, and agents from and against any third party liability, claims, demands, damages, judgments, losses and expenses of any nature, including legal expenses and attorney’s fees, arising out of any theory of liability (including tort, warranty, or strict liability) or out of damage to any property, due to any third party claim alleging that the Services, as delivered, infringes, misappropriates or violates any third party U.S. copyrights, trademarks or patent rights.</p>
      plain:  |
        If someone else sues you because our code or services infringe on their intellectual property rights, we'll defend and cover you.

    - title: 10. Representations and Warranties
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>10.1.

      plain:  |
        We'll do a good job with our services to you, and we won't violate any other agreements or the law in providing them.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>10.3.

        We are not stating anything else to you about the quality of our services beyond what we say in section 10.2.

    - title: 11. Independent Contractor
      legalese: |
        <p>You and Gruntwork are independent parties and nothing in these Terms will constitute either Party or their employees as the employer, principal, or partner of or joint venture with the other Party. Neither you nor Gruntwork has any authority to assume or create any obligation or liability, either express or implied, on behalf of the other.</p>
      plain:  |
        We're not going to become an employee of yours, but we are grateful to become your vendor!

    - title: <span id="non-compete">12. Use of Services to Compete</span>
      legalese: |
        <p>You warrant that you are not in the business of offering, designing, selling, or otherwise distributing reusable infrastructure modules to software companies, and further agree that you will not offer, design, sell, or otherwise distribute reusable infrastructure modules to software companies located in any jurisdiction, so long as Gruntwork is in the business of offering, designing, selling, or otherwise distributing reusable infrastructure modules to software companies. In the event that Gruntwork, at its sole discretion and in good faith, determines that you are competing with Gruntwork in violation of this clause, Gruntwork may, as its sole remedy, terminate these Terms and any and all terms of service for any specific Services upon notice to you, and you shall immediately cease use of all Gruntwork intellectual property upon such termination.</p>
      plain:  |
        If you compete with us by selling reusable infrastructure modules, we will immediately terminate your license.

    - title: 13. Force Majeure
      legalese: |
        <p>No failure or omission by either Party in the performance of any obligation of these Terms will be deemed a breach of these Terms or create any liability if the same will arise from any cause or causes beyond the control of such Party, including, but not limited to, the following: acts of god; acts or omissions of any government; any rules, regulations or orders issued by any governmental authority or by any officer, department, agency or instrumentality thereof; fire; storm; flood; earthquake; accident; war; rebellion; insurrection; riot; and invasion; provided that such Party provides notice to the other Party of such an event and such failure or omission resulting from one of the above causes is cured as soon as is practicable.</p>
      plain:  |
        If an earthquake or some other kind of major crisis occurs and we can't deliver our services to you, you can't consider that a breach of contract, as long as we deliver on our commitment to you as soon as we reasonably can.

      legalese: |
        <p>Any notice or other communication pursuant to these Terms will be in writing and use one of the following types of delivery, each of which is a writing for purposes of these Terms: personal delivery, mail (registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return-receipt requested), nationally recognized overnight courier (fees prepaid), or email. Gruntwork shall address notices to you to the mailing address and email address you list in your registration form when you sign up for the Services. You shall address notices to Gruntwork to: 221 E Indianola Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85012, and via email to legal@gruntwork.io.</p>
      plain:  |
        An official notice under this agreement can be sent by personal delivery, registered or certified mail, overnight courier, or email.

    - title: 15. Assignment
      legalese: |
        <p>Neither Party will assign, subcontract, delegate, or otherwise transfer these Terms, or its rights and obligations herein, without obtaining the prior written consent of the other Party, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void; provided, however, that either Party may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, or other operation of law, without the consent of the other Party. The terms of these Terms will be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>
      plain:  |
        You can't assign this agreement to someone else, but if you're acquired by or merged with another company, the agreement will transfer to the new company.

    - title: 16. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
      legalese: |
        <p>These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware. The Parties agree that any disputes related to these Terms not otherwise resolved as set forth in this section 16 will be brought and maintained exclusively in the federal and state courts of the State of Delaware. If any controversy, claim or dispute arises out of or relating to these Terms, including the breach or interpretation of these Terms or the terms of service for any specific Services (collectively, a “Dispute”), each Party shall designate an executive who is authorized to investigate, negotiate and settle the Dispute. The executives shall exercise good faith efforts to settle the Dispute. If the executives do not resolve the Dispute within 30 days (or an extended period if they so agree) of the initial notice of the Dispute from one Party to the other, then the Parties may pursue the Dispute in courts in accordance with this section. No court or other action pertaining to a Dispute shall be pursued unless this dispute resolution procedure has been exhausted. Nonetheless, either Party at any time may pursue equitable relief before any court of competent jurisdiction in order to protect its intellectual property rights or Confidential Information.</p>
      plain:  |
        If we have a dispute, we'll attempt to settle it directly with each other for at least 30 days. If that fails, either of us can bring a court action in the state of Delaware, which is generally considered to have well-defined business laws.

    - title: 17. Miscellaneous
      legalese: |
        <p>These Terms and any and all terms of service of the specific Services you register for or otherwise utilize constitute the entire understanding and agreement of the Parties, and supersedes all prior written or oral agreements with respect to the subject matter of these Terms; provided, however, that if you or your organization is bound by an MSA, then these Terms will apply, if at all, only to the use of the Services to the extent such use is not already governed by the MSA. The failure to exercise any right provided in these Terms by a Party will not be a waiver of prior or subsequent rights by such Party. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will nevertheless continue in full force and effect, and the Parties will, in good faith, attempt to modify the invalid provision so it becomes a valid provision.</p>
      plain:  |
        This agreement overrides any other verbal or other written agreement we might have, unless we have an existing Master Services Agreement, in which case this agreement only adds to to the Master Services Agreement but does not take away anything.

  category_id: gruntwork-houston
  category_description: This attachment was last updated on September 17, 2018.

You may only access and use Gruntwork Houston (“Houston”) if you have a current and valid Gruntwork Subscription.
  items:
    - title: 1. Term and Termination
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>1.1. Term and Termination.</strong> Your use of Houston, and these Houston Terms, will begin on the date you deploy Houston in your Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) account(s) until the earlier of (a) the termination of your Gruntwork Subscription or (b) the termination of your use of Houston and these Houston Terms pursuant to Section 1.2 or 1.3 below.</p>
        <p><strong>1.2. Your Termination for Convenience.</strong> Your use of Houston, and these Houston Terms, may be terminated by you on provision of at least 15 days’ written notice to Gruntwork that clearly identifies Houston.</p>
        <p><strong>1.3. Termination by Gruntwork.</strong> You will be in default of these Gruntwork Houston Terms if: (a) you fail to timely pay any amount owed to us or an Affiliate of ours; (b) you or an Authorized User breach any provision of the Terms or these Gruntwork Houston Terms or violate any published policy applicable to Houston; (c) you are or become subject to any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or similar laws; or (d) if, in our sole discretion, we believe that your or your Authorized Users’ continued use of Houston creates legal risk for Gruntwork or presents a threat to the security of Houston, the Services or other Gruntwork customers.  If you are in default, Gruntwork may, without notice: (i) suspend your account and use of Houston; (ii) terminate your account; (iii) charge reactivation fees in order to reactivate your account; and (iv) pursue any other remedy available to us.</p>
        <p><strong>1.4. Post-Termination Usage Rights.</strong> Upon termination of Houston, Gruntwork shall immediately revoke your access to Houston, and you shall immediately cease use of all Gruntwork intellectual property related to Houston.  Termination of your use of Houston, and these Houston Terms, shall represent termination only of Houston and these Houston Terms, and shall not affect any other Services or terms which Gruntwork and you may then have outstanding.</p>
        <p><strong>1.5. Post-Termination Data Rights.</strong> Because Houston is designed to create a unified experience around your existing third-party software tools, termination of your use of Houston will not affect your access to the data stored in your third-party tools. Any data stored specifically for the operation of Houston is stored in your own Amazon Web Services account(s). Following termination of your use of Houston, you may not access such Houston-specific data via Houston user interfaces or APIs, but you shall maintain access via standard AWS interfaces.</p>

    - title: 2. Payment Terms
      legalese: |
        <p>Your payment for the Gruntwork Subscription entitles your Authorized Users for your Gruntwork Subscription to also use Houston.</p>

    - title: 3. Included Features
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>3.1. About Gruntwork Houston.</strong> Houston is a web-based service that provides a central place where your development and operations teams can manage your infrastructure. Houston runs directly in your AWS account, and includes a command line tool to allow interacting with Houston from the terminal. Houston is a standalone product and not part of the Infrastructure as Code Library. Each Authorized User will have access to the Houston services and Houston downloadable tools, but not to the Houston source code repository, which shall remain private to Gruntwork.</p>
        <p><strong>3.2. Authentication to Amazon Web Services.</strong> Houston enables you to authenticate to one or more of your AWS accounts using any Identity Provider that is compatible with Houston and which you configure for use with Houston. An “Identity Provider” is a system entity that creates, maintains, and manages identity information for principals while providing authentication services to relying party applications within a federation or distributed network.</p>
        <p><strong>3.3. Updates to Gruntwork Houston.</strong> From time to time, Gruntwork will release new features, bug fixes, security patches, automated tests, documentation, and other improvements to Houston (collectively, “Houston Updates”). You are responsible for deploying updates to Houston when they become available, however Houston may periodically query Gruntwork-managed services for Houston Updates and install Houston Updates automatically if they are available.</p>

      legalese: |
        <p><strong>4.1. Certain Features Require Configuration.</strong> You will be required to configure or deploy modules and tools according to Gruntwork's instructions in order to use certain features of Houston. Your failure to configure or deploy specific modules and tools according to Gruntwork's instructions may affect your ability to utilize certain Houston features.</p>
        <p><strong>4.2. Protecting Your AWS Account.</strong> Because Houston runs in your AWS account, any user with privileged access to that account will be capable of subverting Houston’s security measures. Therefore, it is your responsibility to ensure that only trusted members of your team have privileged access to the AWS account in which Houston runs. The security of your AWS account is your responsibility, and you are solely liable for any claim, damage or other liabilities of any nature suffered by Gruntwork or any third party due to the act of any individuals using your AWS account, provided that such claim, damage or other liabilities are not directly due to Gruntwork’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p>
        <p><strong>4.3. Protecting Your Identity Provider.</strong> By design, Houston trusts all assertions made by your Identity Provider and has no direct control over its configuration. The security and configuration of your Identity Provider is your responsibility, and you are solely liable for any claim, damage or other liabilities of any nature suffered by Gruntwork or any third party based on Gruntwork’s use of your configuration of your Identity Provider.</p>

    - title: 5. Additional Provisions
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>5.1 No Derivative Works or Modification.</strong> Notwithstanding Section 6.1 of the Terms, you are prohibited from creating derivative works of or otherwise modifying Houston.</p>
        <p><strong>5.2 License to Customer Data.</strong> “Customer Data” means any data or information automatically collected by Gruntwork, through your use of Houston, relating to your infrastructure and AWS accounts that you connect to and manage with Houston. Between you and Gruntwork, you shall own all right, title, and interest in and to Customer Data.  It is your sole responsibility to backup your Customer Data, and you agree and acknowledge that post termination of these Houston Terms, you may not have access to your Customer Data.  You hereby grant to Gruntwork a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to (a) use, copy, reproduce, store, display, modify and make derivative works of Customer Data solely for purposes of providing the Services to you, and (b) use the Customer Data, in aggregate and anonymous format (not identifiable to you), for any business or commercial purpose, including statistical analysis with respect to usage and traffic patterns, improving the Services, in connection with the further development of the Services, or for marketing and reporting purposes.</p>
        <p><strong>5.3. Disclaimer of Warranties.</strong> In addition to the disclaimer of warranties in the Terms, Gruntwork will have no responsibility or liability of any kind arising or resulting from: (a) your or your Authorized Users’ use of any version of Houston other than the then-current unmodified version provided to you; (b) problems caused by failed Internet connections or other hardware, software or equipment which is not owned, controlled or operated by Gruntwork; (c) nonconformities resulting from abuse, negligence, or improper or unauthorized use of all or any part of Houston; or (d) material modification, amendment, revision, or change to Houston by any party other than Gruntwork or Gruntwork-authorized representatives.</p>
        <p><strong>5.4. Data Security.</strong> Gruntwork will implement and maintain reasonable practices, procedures, and systems, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to (i) protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Customer Data; (ii) ensure against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of Customer Data; (iii) protect against unauthorized access to or use of Customer Data; and (iv) otherwise comply with its obligations under the terms of this Agreement.  These safeguards include, without limitation, a written data security plan, employee training, information access controls, and restricted disclosures.</p>
        <p><strong>5.5. Sensitive Data.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that although Houston is designed to collect and store Customer Data, Houston is not designed to store personally identifiable information or other sensitive information except personally identifiable information related to your Authorized Users.
