      legalese: |
        <p><strong>5.1.

      plain: |
        The services require an annual subscription. Your subscription will renew every 12 months.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>5.2. Termination by Either Party for Convenience.</strong>
        <p><strong>5.2.1. </strong>Subject to <a href="#5-6-effects-of-suspension-or-termination" title="Section 5.6">Section 5.6</a>, you may terminate these Terms in their entirety, or the terms of a specific Service, as of the next Renewal Date by giving at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Gruntwork of such termination. Upon receipt of a termination notice, any outstanding balances due to Gruntwork for the remainder of the Minimum Term or Renewal Term, as applicable, will be due in full within fifteen (15) days. For example, if you terminate your use of the Gruntwork Subscription 3 months into a 12-month Minimum Term or Renewal Term and you have paid Fees for the 3 months, you will immediately owe Gruntwork an amount equal to the Fees for the remaining 9 months of the Minimum Term or Renewal Term, as applicable. Gruntwork will continue to provide the Services for the remainder of the then-current Minimum Term or Renewal Term, as applicable, provided Gruntwork has not terminated or suspended the Terms or your Services for cause pursuant to Sections <a href="#5-3-termination-for-cause-by-either-party" title="Section 5.3"> 5.3 </a>or
        <a href="#5-4-termination-for-cause-by-gruntwork" title="Section 5.4">5.4</a> below. </p>

      plain: |
        If you want to cancel, just let us know at least 30 days before your contract renews. If you cancel in the middle of your subscription period, you’ll owe us the remaining amount for the entire subscription period. Of course, you'll also have access to the service for the remainder of the period.
        <br/><br/>
        Per <a href="#5-7-post-termination-license" title='Section 5.7.'>Section 5.7</a>, after your subscription ends, you can still use the code!
    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>5.3. Termination for Cause by Either Party.</strong> Either Gruntwork or you may terminate these Terms in their entirety, or the terms of any specific Service, at any time upon the material breach of these Terms or any published policy applicable to the Services by the other Party (or an Authorized User) with at least fourteen (14) days' prior written notice to the other Party, provided that the material breach has not been cured prior to the end of the notice period. Any such termination must clearly identify these Terms.</p>
        <p><strong>5.4. Termination for Cause by Gruntwork.</strong> Notwithstanding anything stated to the contrary in these Terms, you will be in default of these Terms, including, without limitation, any terms applicable to specific Services, if:<br/>
          (a) you fail to timely pay any amount owed to us or our Affiliates; <br>
          (b) you are or become subject to any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or similar laws; <br/>
          (c) we, in our sole discretion and in good faith, believe you have breached your warranty set forth in <a href="#15-use-of-services-to-compete">Section 15</a> (Use of Services to Compete); or <br/>
          (d) if, in our sole discretion, we believe that you or your Authorized Users’ continued use of the Services creates legal risk for Gruntwork or presents a threat to the security of the Services or other Gruntwork customers. <br/> <br/>
          Notwithstanding anything stated to the contrary in these Terms, if you are in default, Gruntwork may, without notice: <br/>
          (a) suspend your account and use of all or any of the Services; <br/>
          (b) terminate these Terms, including, without limitation, the License set forth in <a href="#6-intellectual-property-rights" title="Intellectual Property Rights">Section 6</a>; and <br/>
          (c) pursue any other remedy available to us.<br/></p>
      plain: |
        If either of us fails to live up to these terms, we have to let the other one know, and if the problem isn’t fixed within 30 days, the agreement between us will terminate. Under certain very specific circumstances, we can suspend or terminate your account immediately.

Notwithstanding anything stated to the contrary in these Terms, if you terminate your Gruntwork Subscription during the Trial Period, (a) Gruntwork will refund you all Fees for all Services; (b) you will not be subject to the Minimum Term; (c) you must immediately cease use of all Services; and (d) the License set forth in <a href="#6-intellectual-property-rights" title="Intellectual Property Rights">Section 6</a> will terminate immediately.</p>
      plain: |
        If you cancel within the first 30 days, we’ll refund 100% of your money and let you out of your annual subscription, but you lose the license to all our code and must delete all copies of it.
    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>5.6. Effects of Suspension or Termination.</strong> If, at any time, any of the Services or the Terms (or any portion hereof) are suspended or terminated for any reason (other than by you during the Trial Period), you will not be entitled to a refund of any amounts paid, to the fullest extent permitted by law. Notwithstanding anything stated to the contrary, all Sections of these Terms that either explicitly or by their nature must remain in effect after termination of the Terms, shall survive termination.</p>
      plain: |
        Unless you cancel during the <a href="#5-5-trial-period" title="Trial Period">Trial Period</a> or Gruntwork fails to live up to these terms, you will need to pay for the entire annual subscription.
    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>5.7. Post-Termination License.</strong> If, at any time, all or any portion of the Terms or your Services are terminated (other than by you during the Trial Period or by Gruntwork for cause pursuant to <a href="#5-2-termination-by-either-party-for-convenience" title='Section 5.2'>Section 5.2</a> or <a href="#5-3-termination-for-cause-by-either-party" title="Section 5.3"> Section 5.3 </a> of the General Terms), the License (defined below) will remain in effect for (x) all of your forks of the Gruntwork source code repositories and CIS Modules (defined below) as of the termination date, and (y) any Reference Architecture (including, any source code repositories) created by Gruntwork specifically for you. Gruntwork recommends that, prior to the termination date, you fork any Gruntwork source code repositories and update your infrastructure code to remove all references to any private Gruntwork source code repositories.</p>
      plain: |
        If you stick with the annual subscription for at least one year, even if you cancel, you can keep using all the code you had access to at the time of cancellation at no additional cost. <br/> <br/>
        We recommend that before termination, you fork any Gruntwork repos and update your infrastructure code to remove all references to private Gruntwork repos.

        <p><strong>6.9. Gruntwork Use of Open Source Software.</strong> You acknowledge that from time to time Gruntwork may utilize third-party software, such as publicly-distributed software (e.g., third-party software commonly known as “free software” or “open source software” subject to one or more third-party license agreements), or other third-party documentation and information in generating the Services or otherwise providing products or services to you under these Terms. Gruntwork may incorporate such third-party software into the Services or make use of such third-party software in the Services. If the third-party software uses a GPL, LGPL, or MPL license, Gruntwork will ensure the use of that third-party software in the Services does not trigger GPL, LGPL, or MPL obligations commonly referred to as “viral” obligations. Gruntwork will at all times use such third-party software only in accordance with Gruntwork’s Open Source Usage Policy located at <a href="https://gruntwork.io/open-source-policy" title="Gruntwork Open Source Policy">https://gruntwork.io/open-source-policy</a>, which may be updated from time to time but at all times will meet industry standards.</p>
      plain: |
        Some of the code in our library contains open source tools that use a “copyleft” license like GPL (e.g. <code>wget</code>). We won’t modify these tools in such a way that we trigger a “viral” obligation that requires our code (or your derivative works from our code) to be released as GPL. We’ll always comply with <a href="/open-source-policy" title="Gruntwork’s Open Source Usage Policy">Gruntwork’s Open Source Usage Policy</a> when using open source software.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>6.10. Your Use of Open Source Software.</strong> You also acknowledge that, under the terms of the License granted herein, you agree not to distribute the Services or any derivative of the Services in any way and, as such, acknowledge and agree that you will not “convey” any Services or derivative of the Services in a manner that would trigger GPL, LGPL, or MPL obligations commonly referred to as “viral” obligations. In the event you produce any derivative work from any portion of the Services, or otherwise modify the Services, you shall be solely responsible for ensuring that such derivatives or modifications comply with the terms of the licenses to any third-party software incorporated into the Services.</p>
      plain: |
        In <a href="#6-9-gruntwork-use-of-open-source-software" title="Section 6.9">Section 6.9</a> we made a commitment not to modify any open source code in a way that triggers a “viral” obligation.
        <br/> <br/>
        Here, we ask you to do the same. In practice, this means that if you modify our code, you can’t modify any GPL code that we distribute with the code. For example, we use <code>wget</code> in many of our bash scripts. If you need to make a change to how we use <code>wget</code>, don’t modify <code>wget</code> itself because the GPL license on <code>wget</code> will then require that all the code that uses <code>wget</code> be made GPL as well.
        <br/> <br/>
        TL;DR: Don’t modify source code written by a third party when you submit a Pull Request to us.

      legalese: |
        <p><strong>6.11. Feedback.</strong> You hereby grant Gruntwork a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use, reproduce, translate, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, and incorporate into the Services, any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or other feedback provided by you or your Authorized Users relating to Services. Notwithstanding anything stated to the contrary in the Terms, this irrevocable license will continue after the expiry or termination of these Terms for any reason.</p>
      plain: |
        If you give us a great idea, we get to use it and share it!


    - title: 7. Third-Party Applications
      legalese: |
        <p>From time to time, Gruntwork may offer to you the ability to access, or the Services may be integrated or interact with, third party applications, websites, and services (“Third-Party Applications”) to make the Services available to you. These Third-Party Applications may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies. Your use of these Third-Party Applications will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies. You understand and agree that Gruntwork does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third-Party Applications, nor does Gruntwork warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third-Party Applications with the Services.</p>
      plain: |
        When using Gruntwork, you may need to access third-party services like GitHub or Slack, and they may require you to agree to their own terms and conditions and policies. You should carefully review those before agreeing to them.

    - title: 8. Confidentiality
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>8.1. Mutual Non-Disclosure.</strong> You and Gruntwork acknowledge that during the course of Gruntwork performing the Services, each Party may disclose information that is confidential and proprietary to such Party, its vendors or its customers (“Confidential Information”) to the other Party to facilitate work under these Terms. You and Gruntwork agree that each of you will hold the other Party’s Confidential Information in confidence. You and Gruntwork agree that each of you will only use the other Party’s Confidential Information as expressly authorized by these Terms, and in the preparation of the Services or in integrating the Services with your other products, and will not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party without the written permission of the Party disclosing the Confidential Information.</p>
      plain: |
        We won’t share any confidential information about you, and you agree not to share any confidential information about us, including our code.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>8.2. Protection of Confidential Information.</strong> Each Party will protect Confidential Information disclosed to it by taking reasonable precautions to avoid disclosure which are at least as restrictive as the precautions it uses to protect its own proprietary information, but in no event less than reasonable care, and will limit access to the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to those of its employees or agents who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein. The foregoing are collectively referred to herein as the “Obligations of Confidentiality.”
      plain: |
        We’ll each treat each other’s confidential information at least as carefully as we treat our own.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>8.3. Definition of Confidential Information.</strong> The Obligations of Confidentiality shall apply regardless of the form the Confidential Information takes. Subject to <a href="#8-6-included-in-gruntwork-confidential-information" title="Included in Gruntwork Confidential Information">Section 8.6</a>, to be treated as Confidential Information under this section, written information must be marked as “Confidential Information” in writing at the time of its transmittal. Confidential Information disclosed orally or in any form other than a document must be identified as proprietary at the time of disclosure and then described in a writing, suitably marked as “Confidential Information”, provided to the receiving Party within thirty (30) days of the disclosure. Confidential information will not include information that: (a) was already known to the Party to which it is disclosed before its disclosure under these Terms; (b) is or becomes publicly known without breach of these Terms; (c) is developed by a receiving Party independently without reference to the relevant confidential information of the disclosing Party; or (d) is obtained from third parties which have no obligations to keep such information confidential to the Parties to these Terms.</p>
      plain: |
        This is a pretty typical definition of Confidential Information, and what’s specifically not considered Confidential Information.
    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>8.4. Mandatory Disclosure.</strong> The Parties may disclose Confidential Information without liability hereunder to comply with applicable law or in response to a valid order of requirement by a court or other governmental body, provided that the receiving Party gives the disclosing Party prior written notice of such disclosure in order to permit the disclosing Party to seek an appropriate protective order.</p>
        <p><strong>8.5. Survival of Obligations Upon Termination.</strong> The Obligation of Confidentiality will survive termination of these Terms for three years.</p>
        <p><strong>8.6. Included in Gruntwork Confidential Information.</strong> You agree that the Services and all portions thereof is Confidential Information of Gruntwork unless or until publicly disclosed or publicly distributed by Gruntwork.</p>

      plain: |
        If a government body tells either of us we have to disclose the other’s confidential information, we’ll do it, but we’ll make sure to update the other party on what happened.

    - title: 9. Privacy and Data Security

You acknowledge and agree that Gruntwork has no expectation of processing Personal Data of Your End Users; and you further agree that you have not, and will not, issue any instructions, written or otherwise, to Gruntwork to do so. To the extent that End User Personal Data is nonetheless introduced into data provided to Gruntwork in the provision of the Services in violation of this <a href="#9-5-customer-responsibilities-for-customer-information-and-autho" title="Customer Responsibilities for Customer Information and Authorized Users">Section 9.5</a>, you agree that you are the data controller and that there is no intention on Gruntwork’s part to be a data processor on your behalf.

        <p>These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Arizona. The Parties agree that any disputes related to these Terms not otherwise resolved as set forth in this Section 19 will be brought and maintained exclusively in the federal and state courts located in Maricopa County, Arizona. If any controversy, claim or dispute arises out of or relating to these Terms, including, without limitation, the breach or interpretation of these Terms (collectively, a “Dispute”), each Party shall designate an executive who is authorized to investigate, negotiate and settle the Dispute. The executives shall exercise good faith efforts to settle the Dispute. If the executives do not resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days (or an extended period if they so agree) of the initial notice of the Dispute from one Party to the other, then the Parties may pursue the Dispute in courts in accordance with this section. No court or other action pertaining to a Dispute shall be pursued unless this dispute resolution procedure has been exhausted. Nonetheless, either Party at any time may pursue equitable relief before any court of competent jurisdiction in order to protect its intellectual property rights or Confidential Information.</p>
      plain: |
        If we have a dispute, we’ll attempt to settle it directly with each other for at least 30 days. If that fails, either of us can bring a court action in Maricopa County, Arizona.

    - title: 20. Miscellaneous
      legalese: |
        <p>The Agreements, including, without limitation, these Terms and your GSA, if any, constitute the entire understanding and agreement of the Parties, and supersedes all prior written or oral agreements with respect to the subject matter of these Terms. The failure to exercise any right provided in these Terms by a Party will not be a waiver of prior or subsequent rights by such Party. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will nevertheless continue in full force and effect, and the Parties will, in good faith, attempt to modify the invalid provision so it becomes a valid provision.</p>
      plain: |
        This agreement overrides any other verbal or other written agreement we might have related to the services, unless we have an existing Master Services Agreement or similar agreement, in which case this agreement only adds to the other agreement but does not take away anything.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>2.3. CIS Compliant Reference Architecture.</strong> If you elect to purchase both the Reference Architecture and CIS Compliance, you may request, at no additional cost to you, that Gruntwork design, implement, and deploy a Reference Architecture that is intended to be compliant with as many of the requirements of the CIS Benchmark as is possible (the “CIS Reference Architecture”).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that CIS Compliance, the CIS Modules and the CIS Reference Architecture may not be “fully” compliant with the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, as further described in <a href="#4-1-full-compliance-with-cis-aws-foundations-benchmark">Section 4.1</a> below.</p>
      plain: |
        We will do our best to comply with as many CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark requirements as possible, but we cannot guarantee that we will be compliant with every single requirement.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>2.4. CIS Compliance Support.</strong> You may submit a support request relating to CIS Compliance to Gruntwork (a “CIS Support Request”). CIS Support Requests may involve: (i) questions regarding compliance with the CIS Benchmark, how to use the CIS Modules, or questions regarding the CIS Reference Architecture, (ii) troubleshooting, and (iii) bug fixes.  Gruntwork shall not be obligated to provide custom development in response to a CIS Support Request; provided, however, that Gruntwork, at its sole discretion, may offer to perform custom development for free (e.g., for bug fixes).  Any Authorized User may submit a CIS Support Request using the applicable channels listed in <a href="#3-included-features-1">Section 3</a> of the Support Terms.</p>
      plain: |
        While we cannot promise free custom development, we will try our best to resolve your questions, concerns and issues.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>2.5. Updates to CIS Compliance.</strong> Within one (1) calendar quarter after the calendar quarter in which CIS releases a new version of the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, Gruntwork shall commence work on updating CIS Compliance, the CIS Modules, and/or the CIS Reference Architecture to be compliant with as many of the requirements of the updated CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark as is possible, provided that any such updates to CIS Compliance, the CIS Modules and CIS Reference Architecture may not be “fully” compliant with the updated CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, as further described in <a href="#4-1-full-compliance-with-cis-aws-foundations-benchmark">Section 4.1</a> below. Accordingly, Gruntwork will, from time to time, release new versions, features, bug fixes, security patches, automated tests, documentation, and other improvements to CIS Compliance, the CIS Modules, and/or the CIS Reference Architecture (collectively, “CIS Compliance Updates”). You are responsible for deploying any CIS Compliance Updates when they become available.</p>
      plain: |
        You can expect updates and improvements to CIS Compliance, the CIS Modules and/or the CIS Reference Architecture within one calendar quarter after the calendar quarter in which CIS releases a new version of CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark.

    - title: 3. Compliance with CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
      legalese: |
        <p>The CIS Modules are certified by CIS for compliance with the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the CIS Modules and the CIS Reference Architecture do not guarantee compliance with every requirement under the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, including, without limitation, requirements that by their nature must be implemented or enforced by you or your team. As a result, the CIS Modules and the CIS Reference Architecture only ensure compliance with as many requirements of the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark that are capable of being implemented by the CIS Modules or the CIS Reference Architecture, as applicable. For example, the CIS Modules and the CIS Reference Architecture cannot ensure compliance with the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark requirement that none of your users use a “root account” because Gruntwork cannot force you to implement and enforce a “root account” policy. Therefore, in order to achieve “full” compliance with the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, you will need to independently implement and enforce certain requirements of the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark.</p>
      plain: |
        We’ll take responsibility for our CIS Modules being certified by CIS, but we cannot guarantee compliance with every CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark requirement because, by their nature, some requirements must be implemented by you.

    - title: 4. Additional Provisions
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>4.1. Disclaimer of Warranties.</strong> In addition to the disclaimer of warranties in the Terms, Gruntwork will have no responsibility or liability of any kind arising or resulting from your failure to (a) comply with the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark (or any updates thereto); (b) adequately validate compliance with the requirements of the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark; or (c) independently implement and enforce certain requirements of the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark.</p>
