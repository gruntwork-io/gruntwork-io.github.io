    <h2>Gruntwork is a Human-Friendly Company.</h2>
    <p>We aim to build a company:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Where you get to take on big challenges, but the hours are reasonable.</li>
      <li>Where everyone is treated fairly and with respect, but where disagreement is welcome.</li>
      <li>Where the team takes great pride in our craft, but also gets things done.</li>
      <li>Where we are all focused on advancing the company's mission, but get plenty of time off.</li>
      <li>That is welcoming, safe, and inclusive for people of all backgrounds and identities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In short, <strong>we want to work on interesting problems, with interesting people, while leading interesting lives.</strong></p>

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <p>Our benefits reflect our values. We believe compensation should be fair, transparent, and generous. We hire Grunts in many countries, so some details may vary.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Above-Market Salary.</strong> To reduce bias and increase transparency, we compute all salaries <a href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-we-hire-at-gruntwork-42193d583e24">using formulas</a>. The formula factors in your title and location and uses a multiplier to produce a result that's above market for that title and location.</li>
      <li><strong>Profit-Sharing Bonus.</strong> We set aside a pot of money at the end of each year based on profits and distribute bonuses according to a formula that uses as inputs your level within the company and the length of your tenure at the company.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance Bonus.</strong> We give performance-based bonuses as often as once a quarter, depending on your performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Medical/Dental/Vision Insurance.</strong> We offer a range of high-quality plans with a large portion paid by the company.</li>
      <li><strong>FSA and HSAs.</strong> We don't contribute to these accounts, but we do offer them as an option.</li>
      <li><strong>Pension/401(k).</strong> We contribute a portion of your salary to your pension or 401(k).</li>
      <li><strong>Disability insurance.</strong> If you get disabled, we have a policy that will pay out a portion of your salary.</li>
      <li><strong>Hardware budget.</strong> We'll buy you a brand new 16" Apple MacBook Pro (or other computer of your choosing of equivalent value) upon joining. It will be owned by you, not the company.</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Budget.</strong> We'll give you a personal budget of several hundred dollars per month to spend on your workspace (e.g., a co-working space), health (e.g., gym, yoga), time (e.g., babysitter), and/or learning (e.g., books, courses).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>100% Remote</h3>
    <p>Gruntwork is a remote-first company. That means you can work from home, a co-working space, cafe, or wherever else
      you prefer, there's no commute, and you have complete control over your work hours. To allow at least a few hours
      of overlap between all employees for the occasional live meeting or pair-coding session, we are currently hiring
      from most countries in the time zones between GMT-7 (e.g. California, USA) to GMT+2 (e.g., Berlin, Germany).</p>

    <h3>Life First, Then Work</h3>
    <p>We believe in planning our work around our lives, not the other way around. To help achieve that we offer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Remote work</strong> that lets you control your hours and physical location.</li>
      <li><strong>Normal working hours</strong> that usually amount to not more than ~40h per week, and no working on weekends or holidays.</li>
      <li><strong>Deliberate project planning</strong> that takes into account the time zone of all team members.</li>
      <li><strong>A minimum vacation policy</strong> where you must take <em>at least</em> 4 weeks per year away from work.</li>
      <li><strong>No one carrying a pager</strong> and no on-call rotation. We enable this by only offering support contracts with SLAs of responses on business days / hours only.</li>
    </ul>
