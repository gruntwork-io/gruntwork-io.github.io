        <strong>Gruntwork Platform:</strong> Help us build a fundamentally better DevOps experience. Our SaaS platform 
        (Node.js, TypeScript, Next.js/React, Tailwind) is the gateway to all Gruntwork products, and the tool that customers

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Docs site:</strong> DevOps is "broad and shallow" and teaching our customers both DevOps best practices

    <h2>Sales</h2>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px">DevOps Sales Engineer</h3>

    <p>As a Gruntwork DevOps Sales Engineer, you'll work directly with customers ranging from startups
      to scale-ups to enterprises to help them evaluate Gruntwork on a technical level. You'll also work 
      on improving the evaluation process itself by coming up with new ways to demo the Gruntwork 
      product and creating small enhancements to the product that open up new markets like migrating users 
      from Heroku or CloudFormation. Ideally, you can blog about what you learn, or publish your tooling as
      open source.
    </p>
    <p>Gruntwork is a different type of company with a different type of sales ethos. We serve two key stakeholders:
      (1) our customers and (2) Gruntwork itself. For customers, our mission is to help them make the
      best possible decision for setting up their AWS and Terraform infrastructure, whether that includes Gruntwork
      solutions or not. For Gruntwork, our mission is to help customers understand how the Gruntwork product
      meets our customers' needs. When we achieve both our missions, our sales performance takes care of itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the second DevOps sales engineer, your success will make a significant impact on the
      overall growth of the company. You'll work closely with our principal sales engineer, other Gruntwork
      software engineers, and one of the founders. Your growth path in this role could be as either a star individual
      contributor or team lead (at Gruntwork, we value IC and management roles equally), either on the sales 
      engineer track, or an adjacent one such as software engineer or developer evangelist.
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Understand customer requirements.</strong> The first rule of working with customers is
        to understand their needs. You'll work with customers to identify their requirements and in some 
        cases help to define them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Showcase the product.</strong> Show customers how the Gruntwork
        product works. Answer both their high-level strategic questions and
        low-level technical questions. When necessary, collaborate with the
        engineering team to answer a question or build your knowledge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Develop proofs of concept.</strong> When we find a new customer opportunity
        or market segment, a little tooling and docs could go a long way. You'll study the new
        opportunity, propose a lightweight deliverable and implement it. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Write blog posts.</strong> Share recent insights as a post on the Gruntwork blog,
        which has received millions of views.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Work with a stellar team.</strong>You'll work with two teams. You'll collaborate
        with a team of industry-leading software and DevOps engineers that have written the open source tools
        and battle-tested, production-grade infrastructure-as-code for which Gruntwork is famous. In addition, 
        you'll be part of the (someday famous) Gruntwork sales team.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your Ideal Background</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Significant experience with Terraform and AWS.</strong> You have used 
        Terraform in depth and you know both its charm and its challenges. You've deployed 
        many resources to AWS and run services in prod. There is a special authority that 
        comes from having been in the trenches, so this is the one hard requirement 
        for this role. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Interest in helping others.</strong>You enjoy engaging with and presenting
        to others. You've experienced situations where you worked directly with stakeholders
        and it suited you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Interest in hacking.</strong>You like coding, tinkering, putting together quick demos, 
        and showcasing proofs of concept. If there is a need to implement a narrowly-scoped deliverable
        for a customer, you see this as a fun opportunity. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Moral grounding.</strong> You feel comfortable saying no when necessary 
        or acknowledging the limits of our product so that we can all sleep better
        at night. In general, you do the right thing for customers, for Gruntwork, and for yourself.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What time zones do we work in?</h4>
    <p>
      While Gruntwork <a href="/careers/#sane-working-hours">generally</a> hires
      anywhere between San Francisco and Berlin, candidates for this role must
      be within the GMT-8 to GMT-3 time zones, with a preference for being
      located in the USA or Canada. We expect you'll work primarily with
      customers and fellow Grunts in those time zones, with limited engagement
      with customers worldwide and Grunts in Europe. Working during reasonable
      hours is a priority for us.
