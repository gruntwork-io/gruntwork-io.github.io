    <h4>About this role</h4>

    <p>We're on a mission to make it delightful (yes, delightful) to deploy production-grade, customized, secure cloud
      infrastructure. We accomplish that today with our <a href="/reference-architecture/">Reference Architecture</a> product,
      and now we're ready to take our user experience to the next level.</p>
    <p>As a senior or higher engineer, you'll combine your love of software engineering, DevOps, and improving the developer
      experience for both DevOps engineers and app developers. You'll work closely with a small team of full-stack engineers to make
      big strides towards realizing our bold vision.</p>

    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Build a better DevOps experience.</strong> We have a unique product that generates best-practices AWS
        architectures for Terraform and Terragrunt in just a few hours using a collection of internal Golang tools. Help
        us take this process to the next level of scale and UX as we create the definitive way to go to prod in the cloud.</li>
      <li><strong>Gruntwork platform.</strong> Integrate your new product work with our platform, which consists
        of a REST API (Next.js/Typescript), a web-based single-page app (React/Typescript, Tailwind), and a first-class CLI tool (Go).</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Open source.</strong> Contribute to our open source projects as needed, including

          >bash-commons</a
        >, and more.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Fast feedback loops.</strong> Use the product you're creating to deliver "reference architectures"
        directly to customers. Use their frequent and fast feedback to improve the product and then try out the enhancements
        in the next deployment. Help us get to the point where the entire experience is completely automated or self-service.</li>

        to write blog posts, give talks, contribute to open source, go to conferences,
        talk with customers, do sales calls, interview candidates, mentor new hires,
        design products, come up with marketing ideas, discuss strategy,

      <li>Your happy place is writing code, but you enjoy seeing it in action with real customers.</li>

    <h4>About this role</h4>

    <p>
      At Gruntwork, we have created a library of production-grade infrastructure
      code that is used by thousands of developers around the world. We are
      getting more support & maintenance requests for the library than our small
      team can currently handle, so we are hiring contractors to help us scale
      the team. Although you would start as a contractor, focused on support &
      maintenance, this is a job with a view to full-time employment!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a contractor position, paid based on an hourly rate. We expect an
      average of 10 hours of work per week though it'll fluctuate up and down,
      with more hours on some weeks (e.g., 30 hours) and fewer hours on other
      weeks (e.g., 0 hours).
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="/infrastructure-as-code-library/">Infrastructure as Code Library.</a></strong>
        Create and maintain reusable infrastructure modules for a variety of
        infrastructure (e.g., EKS, ECS, RDS, VPC, Lambda, EC2, S3, ElastiCache,
        etc.), using a variety of tools (e.g., Terraform, Go, Python, Bash,
        Docker, Packer, etc.) on AWS.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Document team knowledge.</strong>
        Capture siloed knowledge and create knowledge base articles, runbooks, and other documentation for the
        internal team as well as Gruntwork customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Open source.</strong>
        Contribute to our open source projects, including <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt" target="_blank">Terragrunt</a>,

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>World-class customer support.</strong> While participating in business-hours only support rotations,
        triage customer requests, teach Gruntwork and DevOps best-practices, help resolve problems, and automate
        and document the solutions so that problems are mitigated for future users.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your Ideal Background</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You have a strong background in software engineering, with 5+ years of experience.</li>
      <li>You have deep experience with AWS.</li>
      <li>You use Terraform on a daily basis to write Infrastructure as Code.</li>
      <li>Ability to write Golang and Bash is a nice to have!</li>
      <li>
        You hate doing the same thing twice and would rather spend the time to
        automate a problem away than do the same work again.
      </li>
      <li>
        You have strong communication skills in English and are comfortable
        engaging with external customers.
      </li>
      <li>You have a passion for learning new technologies and languages.</li>
      <li>You're interested in working a flexible number of hours that averages ~10 hours/week.</li>
      <li>You can respond to support & maintenance requests within a 2 business day SLA.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Compatible time zones</h4>
    <p>
      You'll be working with a team in the <strong>US time zones</strong>, so you can be located in almost any
