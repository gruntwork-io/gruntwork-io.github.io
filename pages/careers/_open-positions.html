        of a REST API (Next.js/Typescript), a web-based single-page app (React/Typescript, Tailwind), and a first-class CLI tool (Go).</li>

    <h4>Now seeking senior and principal levels</h4>

    <p>
      At Gruntwork, we have created a library of production-grade infrastructure
      code that is used by thousands of developers around the world. We are
      getting more support & maintenance requests for the library than our small
      team can currently handle, so we are hiring contractors to help us scale
      the team. Although you would start as a contractor, focused on support &
      maintenance, this is a job with a view to full-time employment!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a contractor position, paid based on an hourly rate. We expect an
      average of 10 hours of work per week though it'll fluctuate up and down,
      with more hours on some weeks (e.g., 30 hours) and fewer hours on other
      weeks (e.g., 0 hours).
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="/infrastructure-as-code-library/">Infrastructure as Code Library.</a></strong>
        Create and maintain reusable infrastructure modules for a variety of
        infrastructure (e.g., EKS, ECS, RDS, VPC, Lambda, EC2, S3, ElastiCache,
        etc.), using a variety of tools (e.g., Terraform, Go, Python, Bash,
        Docker, Packer, etc.) on AWS.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Document team knowledge.</strong>
        Capture siloed knowledge and create knowledge base articles, runbooks, and other documentation for the
        internal team as well as Gruntwork customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Open source.</strong>
        Contribute to our open source projects, including <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt" target="_blank">Terragrunt</a>,

        <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/bash-commons" target="_blank">bash-commons</a>, and more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>World-class customer support.</strong> While participating in business-hours only support rotations,
        triage customer requests, teach Gruntwork and DevOps best-practices, help resolve problems, and automate
        and document the solutions so that problems are mitigated for future users.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your Ideal Background</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You have a strong background in software engineering, with 5+ years of experience.</li>
      <li>You have deep experience with AWS.</li>
      <li>You use Terraform on a daily basis to write Infrastructure as Code.</li>
      <li>Ability to write Golang and Bash is a nice to have!</li>
      <li>
        You hate doing the same thing twice and would rather spend the time to
        automate a problem away than do the same work again.
      </li>
      <li>
        You have strong communication skills in English and are comfortable
        engaging with external customers.
      </li>
      <li>You have a passion for learning new technologies and languages.</li>
      <li>You're interested in working a flexible number of hours that averages ~10 hours/week.</li>
      <li>You can respond to support & maintenance requests within a 2 business day SLA.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Compatible time zones</h4>
    <p>

        a collection of over 350,000 lines of reusable, battle-tested, production-grade infrastructure code for AWS.

    <h4>Compatible time zones</h4>
    <p>
      You'll be working with a team in the <strong>US time zones</strong>, so you can be located in almost any
      country as long as your time zone is no further west than Los Angeles (GMT-8/GMT-7) and no further east than New
      York (GMT-5/GMT-4). We've found that when everyone on the team is located in similar time zones, it's easier to
      collaborate and there's much less pressure to stay up late or get up early, so this is a hard constraint, even if
      you're willing to work hours different from your current time zone.
