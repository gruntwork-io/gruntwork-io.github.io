    <h4>About this role</h4>

    <p>We're on a mission to make it delightful (yes, delightful) to deploy production-grade, customized, secure cloud
      infrastructure. We accomplish that today with our <a href="/reference-architecture/">Reference Architecture</a> product,
      and now we're ready to take our user experience to the next level.</p>
    <p>As a senior or higher engineer, you'll combine your love of software engineering, DevOps, and improving the developer
      experience for both DevOps engineers and app developers. You'll work closely with a small team of full-stack engineers to make
      big strides towards realizing our bold vision.</p>

    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Build a better DevOps experience.</strong> We have a unique product that generates best-practices AWS
        architectures for Terraform and Terragrunt in just a few hours using a collection of internal Golang tools. Help
        us take this process to the next level of scale and UX as we create the definitive way to go to prod in the cloud.</li>
      <li><strong>Gruntwork platform.</strong> Integrate your new product work with our platform, which consists
        of a REST API (Next.js/Typescript), a web-based single-page app (React/Typescript, Tailwind), and a first-class CLI tool (Go).</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Open source.</strong> Contribute to our open source projects as needed, including

      </li>
      <li><strong>Fast feedback loops.</strong> Use the product you're creating to deliver "reference architectures"
        directly to customers. Use their frequent and fast feedback to improve the product and then try out the enhancements
        in the next deployment. Help us get to the point where the entire experience is completely automated or self-service.</li>

    <h4>About this role</h4>

    <p>
      At Gruntwork, we have created a library of production-grade infrastructure
      code that is used by thousands of developers around the world. We are
      getting more support & maintenance requests for the library than our small
      team can currently handle, so we are hiring contractors to help us scale
      the team. Although you would start as a contractor, focused on support &
      maintenance, this is a job with a view to full-time employment!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a contractor position, paid based on an hourly rate. We expect an
      average of 10 hours of work per week though it'll fluctuate up and down,
      with more hours on some weeks (e.g., 30 hours) and fewer hours on other
      weeks (e.g., 0 hours).
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="/infrastructure-as-code-library/">Infrastructure as Code Library.</a></strong>
        Create and maintain reusable infrastructure modules for a variety of
        infrastructure (e.g., EKS, ECS, RDS, VPC, Lambda, EC2, S3, ElastiCache,
        etc.), using a variety of tools (e.g., Terraform, Go, Python, Bash,
        Docker, Packer, etc.) on AWS.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Document team knowledge.</strong>
        Capture siloed knowledge and create knowledge base articles, runbooks, and other documentation for the
        internal team as well as Gruntwork customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Open source.</strong>
        Contribute to our open source projects, including <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt" target="_blank">Terragrunt</a>,

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>World-class customer support.</strong> While participating in business-hours only support rotations,
        triage customer requests, teach Gruntwork and DevOps best-practices, help resolve problems, and automate
        and document the solutions so that problems are mitigated for future users.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your Ideal Background</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You have a strong background in software engineering, with 5+ years of experience.</li>
      <li>You have deep experience with AWS.</li>
      <li>You use Terraform on a daily basis to write Infrastructure as Code.</li>
      <li>Ability to write Golang and Bash is a nice to have!</li>
      <li>
        You hate doing the same thing twice and would rather spend the time to
        automate a problem away than do the same work again.
      </li>
      <li>
        You have strong communication skills in English and are comfortable
        engaging with external customers.
      </li>
      <li>You have a passion for learning new technologies and languages.</li>
      <li>You're interested in working a flexible number of hours that averages ~10 hours/week.</li>
      <li>You can respond to support & maintenance requests within a 2 business day SLA.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Compatible time zones</h4>
    <p>
      You'll be working with a team in the <strong>US time zones</strong>, so you can be located in almost any

    <h4>About this role</h4>
    <p>Gruntwork has built a $5M+ ARR business with zero outside capital by building the world's leading AWS infrastructure-as-code
      library, in use today by over 300 customers and growing. Historically, we've been a "content" business. Now we're ready
      to take things to the next level by creating a new groundbreaking platform that leverages our DevOps thought leadership.</p>
    <p>As the Director of Engineering, we'll look to you to help us manage the team (people), set up operational processes
      as we continue to grow the company (process), and most important of all ship key milestones for both our existing

      <li><strong>Mentor up and coming managers.</strong> Many of our engineers seek to become stronger individual contributors,

        create a second management layer to enable our growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Streamline processes.</strong> Guide other teams to streamline processes as our growth may require, ranging
        from putting in place more robust support management, to streamlining our product delivery.</li>

      <li>You enjoy writing and have a clear, concise style.</li>
      <li>You are equally comfortable making impact through others, or leading small projects yourself if needed.</li>

        <strong>Product vision.</strong>
        As the future owner of several major new products at Gruntwork, we'll look to you for leadership, insights, and
        methodologies that will help us create a shared vision for customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Product execution.</strong>
        We're looking for someone with a proven track record of delivering products that move the needle. You must
        have the ability to lead a team through ideation, prototyping, user testing, development, launch, and iteration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Domain expertise.</strong>
        We don't expect you to know everything coming in, but to create products in our space, you must be able to
        quickly build a deep understanding of our domain: DevOps, cloud software, software delivery, CI / CD, and
        infrastructure as code. Prior experience in software engineering, working on dev tools, or other technical
        domains is required.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Values.</strong>
        You are inspired by <a href="/about/#our-values">our values</a>. Bonus points for a sense of humor, empathy,
        and curiosity.

    <h4>Compatible time zones</h4>
    <p>
      You'll be working with a team in the <strong>US time zones</strong>, so you can be located in almost any
      country as long as your time zone is no further west than Los Angeles (GMT-8/GMT-7) and no further east than New
      York (GMT-5/GMT-4). We've found that when everyone on the team is located in similar time zones, it's easier to
      collaborate and there's much less pressure to stay up late or get up early, so this is a hard constraint, even if
      you're willing to work hours different from your current time zone.
