      We are always ready to add the next Grunt, but as a 100% bootstrapped
      company, we only hire when our revenue supports it, so timing matters. If
      you're inspired by what you've seen and believe in a little serendipity,
      we would love to hear from you. Here are the positions we're currently
      looking for:

    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AWS Architecture Factory.</strong> Our Reference Architecture product creates and fully deploys an end-to-end
        AWS architecture, written entirely in Terraform and Terragrunt, all in about a day. But that's just the beginning. Help us
        realize our ambitious vision that takes this concept to the next level.</li>
      <li><strong>Work directly with customers.</strong> Use our tooling to deliver Reference Architectures to customers, each
        one currently taking about a day, but  hopefully with your help, even less. Use customer feedback to improve the
        product and then try out the enhancements in the next deployment.</li>
      <li><strong>Gruntwork platform.</strong> Help us build a fundamentally better DevOps experience. Our SaaS Platform
        consists of a REST API (Next.js/Typescript), a web-based single-page app (Next.js/Typescript, Tailwind), and a CLI tool (Go).</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Open source.</strong> Contribute to our open source projects as needed, including

        but, depending on your interests, there will also be ample opportunity
        to write blog posts, give talks, contribute to open source, go to conferences,
        talk with customers, do sales calls, interview candidates, mentor new hires,
        design products, come up with marketing ideas, discuss strategy,
        and all the other tasks that are part of working at a small company.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your Ideal Background</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You know how to write code across the stack and have experience in Golang ("Dev").</li>
      <li>You have experience running production software, ideally with Terraform and AWS ("Ops").</li>
      <li>You have a strong background in software engineering.</li>
      <li>Your happy place is writing code, but you enjoy seeing it in action with real customers.</li>
      <li>Bonus points for a sense of humor, empathy, and curiosity.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Compatible time zones</h4>
    <p>This role is specifically for the <strong>GMT-8 (Los Angeles standard time) to GMT-4 (New York daylight time) time zones</strong>,
      though you can be located in almost any country within those time zones. We've found that when everyone on the team
      is located in a similar time zone, it's easier to collaborate and there's much less pressure to stay up late or get
      up early, so this is a hard constraint, even if you're willing to work hours different from your current time zone.</p>

    <h4>Now seeking senior and principal levels</h4>

    <p>
      At Gruntwork, we have created a library of production-grade infrastructure
      code that is used by thousands of developers around the world. We are
      getting more support & maintenance requests for the library than our small
      team can currently handle, so we are hiring contractors to help us scale
      the team. Although you would start as a contractor, focused on support &
      maintenance, this is a job with a view to full-time employment!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a contractor position, paid based on an hourly rate. We expect an
      average of 10 hours of work per week though it'll fluctuate up and down,
      with more hours on some weeks (e.g., 30 hours) and fewer hours on other
      weeks (e.g., 0 hours).
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="/infrastructure-as-code-library/">Infrastructure as Code Library.</a></strong>
        Create and maintain reusable infrastructure modules for a variety of
        infrastructure (e.g., EKS, ECS, RDS, VPC, Lambda, EC2, S3, ElastiCache,
        etc.), using a variety of tools (e.g., Terraform, Go, Python, Bash,
        Docker, Packer, etc.) on AWS.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Document team knowledge.</strong>
        Capture siloed knowledge and create knowledge base articles, runbooks, and other documentation for the
        internal team as well as Gruntwork customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Open source.</strong>
        Contribute to our open source projects, including <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt" target="_blank">Terragrunt</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest" target="_blank">Terratest</a>,

        <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/bash-commons" target="_blank">bash-commons</a>, and more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>World-class customer support.</strong> While participating in business-hours only support rotations,
        triage customer requests, teach Gruntwork and DevOps best-practices, help resolve problems, and automate
        and document the solutions so that problems are mitigated for future users.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your Ideal Background</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You have a strong background in software engineering, with 5+ years of experience.</li>
      <li>You have deep experience with AWS.</li>
      <li>You use Terraform on a daily basis to write Infrastructure as Code.</li>
      <li>Ability to write Golang and Bash is a nice to have!</li>
      <li>
        You hate doing the same thing twice and would rather spend the time to
        automate a problem away than do the same work again.
      </li>
      <li>
        You have strong communication skills in English and are comfortable
        engaging with external customers.
      </li>
      <li>You have a passion for learning new technologies and languages.</li>
      <li>You're interested in working a flexible number of hours that averages ~10 hours/week.</li>
      <li>You can respond to support & maintenance requests within a 2 business day SLA.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Compatible time zones</h4>
    <p>This role is specifically for the <strong>GMT-8 (Los Angeles standard time) to GMT-4 (New York daylight time) time zones</strong>,
