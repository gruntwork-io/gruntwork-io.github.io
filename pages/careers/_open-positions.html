      We are always ready to add the next Grunt, but as a 100% bootstrapped
      company, we only hire when our revenue supports it, so timing matters. If
      you're inspired by what you've seen and believe in a little serendipity,
      we would love to hear from you. Here are the positions we're currently

    <p>
      Be an SRE without being on call! Help Gruntwork develop its internal SRE
      practices as well as offer SRE as a product to enable our hundreds of
      customers to achieve world-class operations and reliability, all while not
      being woken up at 3am!
    </p>
    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Build an SRE product offering:</strong> Create a new product
        offering for Gruntwork customers that includes Production Readiness
        Reviews, training and implementation strategies for SLIs/SLOs/SLAs,
        error budgets, chaos engineering strategies, blame-free post-mortems,
        logging, monitoring, and alerting strategies around availability,
        latency, and overall systems health. This solution will be deployed both
        internally for Gruntwork and externally for our customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spend Max 50% of Your Time On Toil:</strong> We are adamant
        about having our SREs spend 50% of their time or less on

        and the rest on engineering solutions to reduce it for the whole team.
        We enforce this by using a rotational schedule that ensures at least 50%
        of your time is free for engineering work.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No On-Call:</strong> A key goal at Gruntwork is that no one
        should have to be woken up in the middle of the night or on New Year's
        Day due to an outage. We do not have an on-call rotation now and we’re
        building out an SRE team to help us keep it that way. How do we design
        products where outages don’t require paging someone? How do we design
        infrastructure where these outages are rare? What sorts of SLIs, SLOs,
        and SLAs should we promise customers? and the rest engineering solutions
        to reduce it for the whole team.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Document team knowledge:</strong> Capture siloed knowledge and
        create knowledgebase articles, runbooks, and other documentation for the
        internal team as well as Gruntwork customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gruntwork systems:</strong> Own the systems and infrastructure
        that power our web presence, internal tooling, and upcoming Software as
        a Service platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>World-class customer support:</strong> While participating in
        business-hours only support rotations, triage customer requests, teach
        Gruntwork and DevOps best-practices, help resolve problems, escalate to
        internal SMEs, and automate and document the solutions so that problems
        are mitigated for future users.

    <h2>Sales</h2>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Account Executive<br>Director of Sales</h3>

    <p>We're making for our first dedicated sales hire at Gruntwork. We've grown to millions of dollars in annual revenue with zero outside investment/debt, near-zero marketing budget, and a small number of software engineers who handle all sales calls in addition to their core work. Now we're ready to take our sales to the next level!</p>
    <p>Our product is used and purchased by software and DevOps engineers, so we are looking for a sales professional with proven experience selling technical products together with sales engineers. As the first sales hire, you'll report directly to the founders and have considerable impact on the overall growth of the company. Your growth path in this role could be as either a star individual contributor or team lead (at Gruntwork, we value IC and management roles equally).</p>
    <p></p>
  
    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Improve our sales process.</strong> Identify what can be improved about our current sales process, prioritize the changes, and lead the implementation in collaboration with the rest of the team.</li>
      <li><strong>Streamline our sales workflow.</strong> Lay the groundwork for higher personal productivity by streamlining the way we track our deals and helping us adopt best-practices sales tooling.</li>
      <li><strong>Manage deals.</strong> Own the deal from initial inquiry through contract signature. Engage with both large enterprises and startups.</li>
      <li><strong>Showcase the product.</strong> Show customers how the Gruntwork product works. Answer both their high-level strategic questions and common technical questions. When necessary, bring in a member of our engineering team as a sales engineer.</li>
      <li><strong>Business development.</strong> Identify partnership opportunities, prioritize them, and lead their implementation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your Ideal Background</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sales skill.</strong> You can effectively qualify leads, understand customer needs, demo our product, and close the deal with a range of customers from startups to large enterprises. You're disciplined with follow-ups and know how to spend your time to make the most impact.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical skill.</strong> You're tech-savvy, can build a full mental model of our product, and can learn to demo a core part of it on your own without the assistance of sales engineers. At the same time, you have prior experience working with sales engineers and know when to bring them in.</li>
      <li><strong>Sales strategy.</strong> You have done sales for enough tech companies to understand what elements must be present to make a successful sale. You can map that experience to our sales process to lay the groundwork for sales scale.</li>
      <li><strong>Sales leadership.</strong> You know how to recruit other sales people to build your sales team. Once on the team, you can coach and manage them effectively.</li>
      <li><strong>Moral grounding.</strong> You feel comfortable saying no when necessary so that we can all sleep better at night. In general, you do the right thing for customers, for Gruntwork, and for yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What time zones do we work in?</h4>
    <p>While Gruntwork <a href="/careers/#sane-working-hours">generally</a> hires anywhere between San Francisco and Berlin, candidates for this role must be within the GMT-7 to GMT-3 time zones, with a preference for being located in the USA or Canada. We expect you'll work primarily with customers and fellow Grunts in those time zones, with limited engagement with customers worldwide and Grunts in Europe. Working during reasonable hours is a priority for us.</p>
