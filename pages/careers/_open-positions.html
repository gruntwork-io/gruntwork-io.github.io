    <p style="color:gray;">We're also hiring at the <a style="color:gray;" href="#senior-software-engineer-iac">senior level</a> for this role.</p>

    <h4>About this role</h4>

    <p>Gruntwork delivers an end-to-end, best-practices infrastructure on AWS in just days, all as a product. We're known world-wide for DevOps thought leadership, and for our popular open source tools, Terragrunt and Terratest. In this role, you’ll collaborate with other senior-level engineers to define the next generation of AWS and DevOps best practices, codify them for use by thousands of engineers, and design a next-level experience for implementing, operating and understanding them.</p>

    <h4>What you'll work on</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Build a better DevOps experience.</strong> We have a unique product that generates complete, multi-account AWS architectures for Terraform and Terragrunt in just a few hours using a collection of internal Golang tools. Help us take this to the next level by using that product to deliver prod architectures directly to customers, and then leveraging their feedback for improvements. Better yet, help us get to the point where the entire experience is completely automated or self-service.</li>
      <li><strong>Codify AWS and Terraform best practices.</strong> Customers look to Gruntwork to share the best way to launch on AWS. Discover AWS and Terraform best practices, and then codify them as repeatable patterns that Gruntwork customers can pull off the shelf.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrate with the Gruntwork platform.</strong> Integrate your product work with our company-wide platform, which consists of a REST API (Next.js/Typescript), a web-based single-page app (Next.js/React/Typescript, Tailwind), and a first-class CLI tool (Go).</li>
      <li><strong>Build out the <a href="/infrastructure-as-code-library/"> Infrastructure as Code Library</a>.</strong> Create and maintain reusable infrastructure modules for a variety of infrastructure (e.g., EKS, ECS, RDS, VPC, Lambda, EC2, S3, ElastiCache, etc.), using a variety of tools (e.g., Terraform, Go, Python, Bash, Docker, Packer, etc.) on AWS.</li>
      <li><strong>Contribute to open source.</strong> Contribute to our open source projects as needed, including <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt">Terragrunt</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest">Terratest</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke">cloud-nuke</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/bash-commons">bash-commons</a>, and more.</li>
      <li><strong>Train and mentor.</strong> Play to your strengths and areas of expertise by not only writing code and working on the product but also by sharing knowledge and mentoring both other team members and our customers in those areas.</li>
      <li><strong>Support customers.</strong> Gruntwork is a <a href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-we-built-a-distributed-self-funded-family-friendly-profitable-startup-93635feb5ace">small, distributed, self-funded, profitable startup</a>, so we'll ask you to provide a limited amount of support to enable learning directly from customers about how we can improve and continue achieving our vision of making it easier to understand, build, and deploy software.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your ideal background</h4>
    <p style="border: 1px solid #194c5f; background-color: #242e3b; padding: 15px 20px;">You should meet some of these requirements, but you don't need to meet all of them. As a company, we look for people who can leverage their existing skills to make significant impact in the near term. As an individual, you are likely looking for a growth opportunity, a core part of which is building new skills.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You know how to write code across the stack and have experience in one or more of the following: Go, C++, Python, Typescript, Bash, React, Next.js</li>
      <li>You have production-level experience with AWS.</li>
      <li>You have expertise in one or more of the following: Kubernetes (any managed offering, preferably EKS), ECS<, EC2, Lambda / Serverless, API Gateway, RDS, S3, AWS Config, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon GuardDuty, IAM, VPC, VPN.</li>
      <li>You have worked with Terraform or other infrastructure-as-code tools like CloudFormation, CDK, or Pulumi in prod.</li>
      <li>You have experience achieving compliance and going through audits (e.g., SOC2, HIPAA, vendor, etc).</li>
      <li>You have a strong background in software engineering.</li>
      <li>You have strong communication skills in English and are comfortable engaging with external customers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your ideal values</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You have a passion for imparting best practices to other developers.</li>
      <li>But you would rather invest the time to automate a problem than do the same work again.</li>
      <li>You have a passion for learning (new technologies and languages specifically).</li>
      <li>But you are motivated most by making impact.</li>
      <li>You are inspired by <a href="/about/#our-values">our values</a> (bonus points for a sense of humor, empathy, and curiosity).</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Compatible time zones</h4>
    <p>
      You'll be working with a team in the <strong>US time zones</strong>, so you can be located in almost any
      country as long as your typical time zone is no further west than Los Angeles (GMT-8/GMT-7) and no further east than New
      York (GMT-5/GMT-4). We've found that when everyone on the team is located in similar time zones, it's easier to
      collaborate and there's much less pressure to stay up late or get up early, so this is a hard constraint, even if
      you're willing to work hours different from your current time zone.

    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Create a brand new product.</strong>
        Take ownership of a new, unannounced product that we have in the works, which includes both a beautiful, first-class CLI experience and a powerful web UI. Join a small team to help design, prototype, test, launch, and develop this exciting new initiative that we believe will transform the software industry.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Work alongside product and report to the founders.</strong>
        You'll collaborate with a product manager on the vision, usability, and business viability of our product, and take primary responsibility for our ability to execute. Further, you'll report directly to one of Gruntwork's co-founders.

        Manage a team of 3 engineers to help them organize and ship their work, provide mentorship, guide their careers at Gruntwork, and position them for success.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Write code.</strong>
        Your primary job is to manage the team, but while it's still a small team, you will have time left over to write code, helping to directly build out the product and set its technical direction.

        but, depending on your interests, there will also be ample opportunity
        to write blog posts, give talks, contribute to open source, go to conferences,
        talk with customers, do sales calls, interview candidates, mentor new hires,
        design products, come up with marketing ideas, discuss strategy,
        and all the other tasks that are part of working at a small company.

      <li>You enjoy writing and have a clear, concise style.</li>
      <li>You are equally comfortable making impact through others, or leading small projects yourself if needed.</li>
      <li>You are inspired by <a href="/about/#our-values">our values</a>.</li>
      <li>Bonus points for a sense of humor, empathy, and curiosity.</li>

      country as long as your time zone is no further west than the UK (GMT+0/BST) and no further east than Germany
