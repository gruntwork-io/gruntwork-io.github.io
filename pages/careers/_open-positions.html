    <h2>Software Engineering (Contract)</h2>

    <p><strong>Now seeking senior and principal levels</strong></p>

    <p>
      At Gruntwork, we have created a library of production-grade infrastructure
      code that is used by thousands of developers around the world. We are
      getting more support & maintenance requests for the library than our small
      team can currently handle, so we are hiring contractors to help us scale
      the team up and down in response to inquiry volume. Although you would
      start as a contractor, focused on support & maintenance, this is a job
      with a view to full-time employment!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a contractor position, paid based on an hourly rate. We expect an
      average of 10 hours of work per week though it'll fluctuate up and down,
      with more hours on some weeks (e.g., 30 hours) and fewer hours on other
      weeks (e.g., 0 hours).

        etc.), using a variety of tools (e.g., Terraform, Go, Python, Bash,
        Docker, Packer, etc.), atop AWS.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Document team knowledge:</strong> Capture siloed knowledge and
        create knowledgebase articles, runbooks, and other documentation for the
        internal team as well as Gruntwork customers.
      </li>

      <li>Ability to write Golang and Bash is a nice to have!</li>
      <li>
        You hate doing the same thing twice and would rather spend the time to
        automate a problem away than do the same work again.
      </li>
      <li>
        You have strong communication skills in English and are comfortable
        engaging with external customers.

    <h2>Front End Software Engineer</h2>

    <p><strong>Now seeking senior or principal levels</strong></p>

    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Gruntwork Platform:</strong> Help us build a fundamentally better DevOps experience. Our SaaS platform 
        (Node.js, TypeScript, Next.js/React, Tailwind) is the gateway to all Gruntwork products, and the tool that customers
        use to manage their account. It is increasingly the heart of our customer UX with many upcoming high-impact releases.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Docs site:</strong> DevOps is "broad and shallow" and teaching our customers both DevOps best practices
        and how to use our own products is central to our mission. To that end, we are actively working on a complete 
        re-think of how our customers experience and consume our documentation, including novel ideas on next-generation
        developer UX. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>This marketing website!</strong> See something we could improve on this website? Great, because we
        could help use your help here, too! We have a long list of improvements in mind for the structure, content, 
        UX, and messaging of this site so that we can more effectively reach both prospective customers and future Grunts.

        You have a deep understanding of the core technologies we use:
        TypeScript, React, Node.js, Next.js, NextAuth
      </li>
      <li>
        You can write code across the stack, but are especially strong with front end development (HTML/CSS/React/Typescript).
      </li>
      <li>You are well-steeped in HTML and CSS and a fan of the TailWind approach.</li>
      <li>
        You write code that other developers love to read.

    <h2>Sales</h2>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px">Sales Engineer</h3>

    <p>
      We've grown to millions of dollars in annual revenue with zero outside
      investment/debt, near-zero marketing budget, and a small number of
      software engineers who handle all sales calls in addition to their core
      work. Now we're ready to take our sales to the next level!
    </p>
    <p>
      Our product is used and purchased by software and DevOps engineers, so we
      are looking for a sales professional with proven experience selling
      products that enable software engineers. As the first sales hire, you'll
      report directly to the founders and have considerable impact on the
      overall growth of the company. Your growth path in this role could be as
      either a star individual contributor or team lead (at Gruntwork, we value
      IC and management roles equally).
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Manage deals.</strong> Own the deal from inquiry through
        contract signature. Engage with both large enterprises and startups.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Showcase the product.</strong> Show customers how the Gruntwork
        product works. Answer both their high-level strategic questions and
        common technical questions. When necessary, collaborate with our
        engineering team to answer a detailed question or build your knowledge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make customer-driven tweaks where needed.</strong> Does the
        customer want to see an integration out of the box we don't yet support?
        You can add it directly, following the patterns we've laid down with
        other integrations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Develop new markets.</strong> Our product works well for
        customers building greenfield in AWS or doing migrations. What kinds of
        customers might find themselves in that situation? Identify those
        opportunities, figure out what the customer wants, and write
        content/guides to help showcase our solution.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your Ideal Background</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Experience in tech.</strong> You understand the cloud, are
        familiar with core elements of at least one major cloud provider, and
        have experience selling to software engineers. Ideally, you have some
        kind of background in engineering or coding from earlier in your career.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Technical skill.</strong> You're tech-savvy, can build a full
        mental model of our product, and can learn to demo a core part of it on
        your own. At the same time, you know when to bring in the product
        engineers to assist.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sales skill.</strong> You can effectively qualify leads,
        understand customer needs, demo our product, and close the deal with a
        range of customers from startups to large enterprises. You delight both
        in knowing the product and signing up customers who will genuinely
        benefit from it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Moral grounding.</strong> You feel comfortable saying no when
        necessary so that we can all sleep better at night. In general, you do
        the right thing for customers, for Gruntwork, and for yourself.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What time zones do we work in?</h4>
    <p>
      While Gruntwork <a href="/careers/#sane-working-hours">generally</a> hires
      anywhere between San Francisco and Berlin, candidates for this role must
      be within the GMT-7 to GMT-3 time zones, with a preference for being
      located in the USA or Canada. We expect you'll work primarily with
      customers and fellow Grunts in those time zones, with limited engagement
      with customers worldwide and Grunts in Europe. Working during reasonable
      hours is a priority for us.
