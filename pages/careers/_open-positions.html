      We are always ready to add the next Grunt, but as a 100% bootstrapped
      company, we only hire when our revenue supports it, so timing matters. If
      you're inspired by what you've seen and believe in a little serendipity,
      we would love to hear from you. Here are the positions we're currently

    <p>
      Be an SRE without being on call! Help Gruntwork develop its internal SRE
      practices as well as offer SRE as a product to enable our hundreds of
      customers to achieve world-class operations and reliability, all while not
      being woken up at 3am!
    </p>
    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Build an SRE product offering:</strong> Create a new product
        offering for Gruntwork customers that includes Production Readiness
        Reviews, training and implementation strategies for SLIs/SLOs/SLAs,
        error budgets, chaos engineering strategies, blame-free post-mortems,
        logging, monitoring, and alerting strategies around availability,
        latency, and overall systems health. This solution will be deployed both
        internally for Gruntwork and externally for our customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spend Max 50% of Your Time On Toil:</strong> We are adamant
        about having our SREs spend 50% of their time or less on

        >
        and the rest on engineering solutions to reduce it for the whole team.
        We enforce this by using a rotational schedule that ensures at least 50%
        of your time is free for engineering work.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No On-Call:</strong> A key goal at Gruntwork is that no one
        should have to be woken up in the middle of the night or on New Year's
        Day due to an outage. We do not have an on-call rotation now and we’re
        building out an SRE team to help us keep it that way. How do we design
        products where outages don’t require paging someone? How do we design
        infrastructure where these outages are rare? What sorts of SLIs, SLOs,
        and SLAs should we promise customers? and the rest engineering solutions
        to reduce it for the whole team.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Document team knowledge:</strong> Capture siloed knowledge and
        create knowledgebase articles, runbooks, and other documentation for the
        internal team as well as Gruntwork customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gruntwork systems:</strong> Own the systems and infrastructure
        that power our web presence, internal tooling, and upcoming Software as
        a Service platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>World-class customer support:</strong> While participating in
        business-hours only support rotations, triage customer requests, teach
        Gruntwork and DevOps best-practices, help resolve problems, escalate to
        internal SMEs, and automate and document the solutions so that problems
        are mitigated for future users.

    <h2>Sales</h2>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Sales Engineer</h3>

    <p>We've grown to millions of dollars in annual revenue with zero outside investment/debt, near-zero marketing budget, and a small number of software engineers who handle all sales calls in addition to their core work. Now we're ready to take our sales to the next level!</p>
    <p>Our product is used and purchased by software and DevOps engineers, so we are looking for a sales professional with proven experience selling products that enable software engineers. As the first sales hire, you'll report directly to the founders and have considerable impact on the overall growth of the company. Your growth path in this role could be as either a star individual contributor or team lead (at Gruntwork, we value IC and management roles equally).</p>
    <p></p>
  
    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manage deals.</strong> Own the deal from inquiry through contract signature. Engage with both large enterprises and startups.</li>
      <li><strong>Showcase the product.</strong> Show customers how the Gruntwork product works. Answer both their high-level strategic questions and common technical questions. When necessary, collaborate with our engineering team to answer a detailed question or build your knowledge.</li>
      <li><strong>Make customer-driven tweaks where needed.</strong> Does the customer want to see an integration out of the box we don't yet support? You can add it directly, following the patterns we've laid down with other integrations.</li>    
      <li><strong>Develop new markets.</strong> Our product works well for customers building greenfield in AWS or doing migrations. What kinds of customers might find themselves in that situation? Identify those opportunities, figure out what the customer wants, and write content/guides to help showcase our solution.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your Ideal Background</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Experience in tech.</strong> You understand the cloud, are familiar with core elements of at least one major cloud provider, and have experience selling to software engineers. Ideally, you have some kind of background in engineering or coding from earlier in your career.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical skill.</strong> You're tech-savvy, can build a full mental model of our product, and can learn to demo a core part of it on your own. At the same time, you know when to bring in the product engineers to assist.</li>
      <li><strong>Sales skill.</strong> You can effectively qualify leads, understand customer needs, demo our product, and close the deal with a range of customers from startups to large enterprises. You delight both in knowing the product and signing up customers who will genuinely benefit from it.</li>
      <li><strong>Moral grounding.</strong> You feel comfortable saying no when necessary so that we can all sleep better at night. In general, you do the right thing for customers, for Gruntwork, and for yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What time zones do we work in?</h4>
    <p>While Gruntwork <a href="/careers/#sane-working-hours">generally</a> hires anywhere between San Francisco and Berlin, candidates for this role must be within the GMT-7 to GMT-3 time zones, with a preference for being located in the USA or Canada. We expect you'll work primarily with customers and fellow Grunts in those time zones, with limited engagement with customers worldwide and Grunts in Europe. Working during reasonable hours is a priority for us.</p>
