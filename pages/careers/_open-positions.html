      We are always ready to add the next Grunt, but as a 100% bootstrapped
      company, we only hire when our revenue supports it, so timing matters. If
      you're inspired by what you've seen and believe in a little serendipity,
      we would love to hear from you. Here are the positions we're currently

    <p>
      Be an SRE without being on call! Help Gruntwork develop its internal SRE
      practices as well as offer SRE as a product to enable our hundreds of
      customers to achieve world-class operations and reliability, all while not
      being woken up at 3am!
    </p>
    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Build an SRE product offering:</strong> Create a new product
        offering for Gruntwork customers that includes Production Readiness
        Reviews, training and implementation strategies for SLIs/SLOs/SLAs,
        error budgets, chaos engineering strategies, blame-free post-mortems,
        logging, monitoring, and alerting strategies around availability,
        latency, and overall systems health. This solution will be deployed both
        internally for Gruntwork and externally for our customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spend Max 50% of Your Time On Toil:</strong> We are adamant
        about having our SREs spend 50% of their time or less on

        >
        and the rest on engineering solutions to reduce it for the whole team.
        We enforce this by using a rotational schedule that ensures at least 50%
        of your time is free for engineering work.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No On-Call:</strong> A key goal at Gruntwork is that no one
        should have to be woken up in the middle of the night or on New Year's
        Day due to an outage. We do not have an on-call rotation now and we’re
        building out an SRE team to help us keep it that way. How do we design
        products where outages don’t require paging someone? How do we design
        infrastructure where these outages are rare? What sorts of SLIs, SLOs,
        and SLAs should we promise customers? and the rest engineering solutions
        to reduce it for the whole team.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Document tribal knowledge:</strong> Capture siloed knowledge and
        create knowledgebase articles, runbooks, and other documentation for the
        internal team as well as Gruntwork customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gruntwork systems:</strong> Own the systems and infrastructure
        that power our web presence, internal tooling, and upcoming Software as
        a Service platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>World-class customer support:</strong> While participating in
        business-hours only support rotations, triage customer requests, teach
        Gruntwork and DevOps best-practices, help resolve problems, escalate to
        internal SMEs, and automate and document the solutions so that problems
        are mitigated for future users.

    <h2>Sales</h2>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Sales Engineer / Senior Sales Engineer</h3>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Account Executive / Director of Sales</h3>

    <p>We're making for our first dedicated sales hire at Gruntwork. We've grown to millions of dollars in annual revenue
       with zero outside investment/debt, near-zero marketing budget, and a small number of cloud engineers who have handled
       all sales calls in addition to their core work. Now we're ready to professionalize sales.</p>
    <p>As the first sales hire, you'll report directly to the founders and have considerable impact on the overall
      growth of the company. In this role, it's critical that you do actual sales effectively (versus only managing others),
      while at the same time helping us lay the groundwork for a future sales team, whether as a star individual contributor
      or future sales manager (at Gruntwork, we value them equally).</p>
    <p>Because our product is technical in nature, we're exploring two possible directions for our first sales hire:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sales professionals with technical experience</strong> (Account Executive, Director of Sales)</li>
      <li><strong>Technical professionals with sales experience</strong> (Sales Engineer, Senior Sales Engineer)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We'd love to hear your vision for taking Grunwork sales to the next level!</p>
    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manage deals.</strong> Engage with some of the largest enterprise companies in the world as well as cutting-edge new startups. Own the deal from initial inquiry through contract signature. </li>
      <li><strong>Drive sales strategy at Gruntwork.</strong> Help us tailor our approach to different market segments, identify new strategic opportunities, build out a new partner program to drive more sales, and generally fill in the details of our sales strategy.</li>
      <li><strong>Improve the sales pitch.</strong> Work with us to transition from an engineering-centric sales discussion to a sales-focused pitch that still resonates with our technical customers.</li>
      <li><strong>Streamline our sales workflow.</strong> Help us strike the right balance between capturing key data in our CRM (currently salesforce) and maintaining personal productivity and efficiency.</li>
      <li><strong>Light marketing.</strong> Drive a limited set of low-hanging fruit opportunities to bring in more leads, backed by additional budget if needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Lay the groundwork for a sales team.</strong> Help us build the foundation for a future multi-person sales team.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your Ideal Background</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ability to sell.</strong> You've had success selling technical products from initial inquiry to signed contract with both small startups and large enterprises. </li>
      <li><strong>Passionate about the art of sales.</strong> You have studied sales metholodologies and approaches, and can save us time by pattern-matching them to Gruntwork. </li>
      <li><strong>Technical understanding.</strong> You expect to ramp up in our domain so that you have a core set of genuinely valuable technical information to offer customers, and clarity on when to defer to the engineers.</li>
      <li><strong>Moral grounding.</strong> You feel comfortable saying no when necessary so that we can all sleep better at night. In general, you do the right thing, for yourself, for Gruntwork, and for customers. </li>
      <li><strong>Bonus: Technical skill.</strong> You can write code and build tools. You hate manual data entry so you write your own CLI tool to streamline it. You hate manually generating quotes, so you automate the CRM to do it. When customers point out gaps in the docs or product, you fill those gaps to help close the deal.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What time zones do we work in?</h4>
    <p>While Gruntwork <a href="/careers/#sane-working-hours">generally</a> hires anywhere between San Francisco and Berlin, candidates for this role must be within the GMT-7 to GMT-3 time zones, with a preference for being located in the USA or Canada. We expect you'll work primarily with customers and fellow Grunts in those time zones, with limited engagement with customers worldwide and Grunts in Europe. Working during reasonable hours is a priority for us.</p>
