    <h2>Learn DevOps directly from the experts.</h2>
    <p>
      At Gruntwork, we've created a library of video training courses that teach a variety of DevOps topics, such as
      infrastructure as code, Terraform, Docker, Packer, AWS, security, and more. Each course consists of a series of
      "micro-videos" of 1-10 minutes each that you can watch your own pace as many times as you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as with our <a href="/infrastructure-as-code-library">Infrastructure as Code Library</a>, we regularly
      grow and update the DevOps Training Library so that Gruntwork Subscribers are always learning the latest
      techniques and practices.
