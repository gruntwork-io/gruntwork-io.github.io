    <h2>Learn DevOps directly from the experts.</h2>
    <p>
      At Gruntwork, we've created a library of video training courses that teach
      a variety of DevOps topics, such as infrastructure as code, Terraform,
      Docker, Packer, AWS, security, and more. Each course consists of a
      series of "micro-videos" of 1-10 minutes each that you can watch your own
      pace as many times as you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as with our
      <a href="/infrastructure-as-code-library/"
        >Infrastructure as Code Library</a
      >, we regularly grow and update the DevOps Training Library so that
      Gruntwork Subscribers are always learning the latest techniques and
      practices.
