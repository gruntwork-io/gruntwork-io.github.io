how_it_works:
  - heading: Step 1. Get HIPAA-compliant infrastructure, out of-the-box
    image: /assets/img/hipaa/infrastructure-hipaa.png
    image_side: right
    body: |
      Deploy an off-the-shelf, production-grade AWS Architecture that is HIPAA compliant out-of-the-box. The architecture includes: <ul><li>Multi-account Landing Zone</li><li>Networking (VPCs, VPN, SSH, DNS)</li> <li>Orchestration (EKS, ECS, EC2)</li><li>Data Storage (RDS, ElastiCache, ElasticSearch)</li><li>CI / CD (CircleCI, Jenkins, GitLab)</li><li>Monitoring (CloudWatch, CloudTrail, AWS Config)</li><li>End-to-end encryption (TLS, secrets management)</li><li>And much more (<a href="/hipaa-compliance-on-aws/technical-details#reference-infra">see the full list of features</a>)</li></ul>

  - heading: Step 2. Bootstrap your app with our HIPAA-compliant reference applications
    image: /assets/img/hipaa/hipaa-sample-app.png
    image_side: left
    body: |
      Build on top of reference applications for a variety of languages and frameworks (e.g., Node.js/Express, Java/Spring, Ruby/Rails) that show you how to build HIPAA compliant and cloud-native apps, including how to do service discovery, secrets management, schema migrations, encryption, server hardening, and much more (<a href="/hipaa-compliance-on-aws/technical-details/">see full list of features here</a>).

  - heading: Step 3. Work with us to define requirements that meet your needs
    image: /assets/img/hipaa/hipaa-chat.png
    image_side: right
    body: |
      We’ll work with you to ensure that our implementation of the HIPAA requirements satisfies the needs of your organization—and those of your auditors!

  - heading: Step 4. We’ll help you pass your audit
    image: /assets/img/hipaa/grunty-audit.png
    image_width: 350px
    image_side: left
    body: |
      Our team will support you throughout your audit process. If your auditor identifies any issues with the technical safeguards in your infrastructure, the Gruntwork team will jump in to get them fixed.

  - heading: Step 5. Stay up to date automatically via Terraform pull requests
    image: /assets/img/hipaa/stay-up-to-date.png
    image_width: 500px
    image_side: right
    body: |
      The tools we all rely on (AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker), DevOps best practices, and auditor expectations are constantly changing. To help you remain HIPAA compliant, we offer commercial support and maintenance for our app and infrastructure code, all of which is semantically versioned, so you can stay completely up-to-date with the latest compliance requirements, security patches, and AWS/DevOps best practices via simple version number bumps.

  - heading: Step 6. Verify all future code changes against Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies
    precode: |
      <figure><figcaption>Ensure all images come from a trusted registry</figcaption>
           <pre>
            <code class="language-python">
              package kubernetes.admission

              deny[msg] {
                  input.request.kind.kind == "Pod"
                  some i
                  image := input.request.object.spec.containers[i].image
                  not startswith(image, "gruntwork.io")
                  msg := sprintf("image '%v' comes from untrusted registry", [image])
              }
             </code>
          </pre> 
       </figure>
    image_side: left
    body: |
      Gruntwork's HIPAA Architecture comes with a CI/CD pipeline that runs your code against a library of OPA policies to validate that every commit remains in compliance with HIPAA requirements.

  - heading: Step 7. Ensure ongoing compliance with scanning tools
    image: /assets/img/hipaa/aws-security-hub-green.png
    image_width: 500px
    image_side: right
    body: |
      Gruntwork's HIPAA Reference Architecture is configured out-of-the-box to work with compliance scanning tools, so you have continuous monitoring and alerts on your compliance status.

      <h1>Gruntwork Early Access Program</h1>
      <p>
        The Gruntwork Early Access Program (EAP) is the fastest way for you to
        achieve HIPAA compliance on AWS. Over the last 5 years, Gruntwork has
        helped hundreds of companies and thousands of developers go to prod on
        AWS, including achieving
        <a href="/achieve-compliance/">CIS Compliance</a>, and we are now
        actively developing our HIPAA compliance on top of that foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you join the EAP, we'll deploy a CIS Compliant pre-prod environment
        for you on day 1 and a HIPAA-compliant prod environment for you as soon
        as it's available, plus a number of other
        <a href="/hipaa-compliance-on-aws/pricing/"
          >exclusive early-access benefits</a
        >, including audit assistance and prioritized bug fixes.
      </p>
      <p>
        See the table below for all the HIPAA requirements you'll meet with
        Gruntwork today, out of the box, as well as those that are currently in
        progress.
