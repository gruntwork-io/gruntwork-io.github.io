faq:
  - question: Is an annual subscription required?
    answer: |
      <p>
        Gruntwork Pro and Gruntwork Enterprise require an annual subscription, though we can bill you either annually or monthly. Why an annual subscription? We give you access to all the code to run your infrastructure on day 1, and we let you keep that code even if you cancel. If we didn't have the annual subscription requirement, customers could sign up for one day, get access to all the code, and cancel immediately.
        </p>
      <p>
        However, we offer a 30-day money back guarantee, so if for any reason you're not happy after signing up, we'll let you out of the annual subscription and refund 100% of your money in the first 30 days.
      </p>
  - question: How does early access work?
    answer: |
      <p>Early access subscribers to Gruntwork HIPAA will get the full benefit of the Gruntwork CIS offering available today, in addition to direct HIPAA-compliance audit support and the lowest overall cost for the HIPAA-compliance Reference Architecture.</p><p>It can be helpful to think of this program as occuring in 3 distinct phases:</p><ul><li><b>Phase 1: CIS Deployment</b> Early access subscribers will receive a CIS Benchmark compliant Reference Architecture. The CIS Reference Architecture comes complete with CIS hardened base images and already satisfies many of HIPAA's requirements.</li><li><b>Phase 2: Gruntwork completes HIPAA-compliance</b> The Gruntwork team works to implement the final changes to make the Reference Architecture and Reference Applications 100% HIPAA-compliant. See <a href="/hipaa-compliance-on-aws/technical-details/#supported-infrastructure-features">this table for details.</a> As soon as this work is complete, Gruntwork will update your CIS Reference Architecture to be 100% HIPAA-compliant at no extra charge.</li><li><b>Phase 3: Audit assistance</b> Early access subscribers will recieve direct support from Gruntwork, who will go through a third-party HIPAA-compliance audit alongside you and fix any issues the auditor may find.</li></ul>

  - question: What are the benefits of early access?
    answer: |
      <p>Early access subscribers will realize the most benefits from this program: <ul><li><b>Fastest way to get HIPAA-compliance.</b> All early access subscribers receive a complete CIS Reference Architecture as a starting point. All that remains to achieve 100% compliance are the final pieces Gruntwork will be implementing as part of this program.</li><li><b>Discounted pricing.</b> Early access subscribers receive a 50% discount on the subscription price, and can sign up with no up-front fee!</li><li><b>Extra support.</b> You'll be able to chat with the Gruntwork team via a private, shared Slack channel to get help with questions, troubleshooting, design, bugs, and any other issues you hit on your journey toward compliance.</li><li><b>Audit assistance.</b> For early access subscribers only, Gruntwork will go through the HIPAA compliance audit alongside of your team, fixing any issues that arise and implementing any missing features.</li></ul></p>

  - question: What if I want to cancel my Gruntwork Subscription?
    answer: |
      <p>
        We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. You can try out Gruntwork Pro or Gruntwork Enterprise, and if you're not happy for any reason, you can cancel within the first 30 days, and we'll let you out of the annual subscription and refund 100% of your money.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that if you cancel in the first 30 days, you lose the license to the code in the Infrastructure as Code Library, so you must stop using it and delete any references to it; on the other hand, if you do stick with the annual subscription, and cancel after at least one year, you can keep using all the code you had been using up to that point.
      </p>

  - question: What happens to my code if I cancel my subscription?
    answer: |
      <p>
        If you cancel within the first 30 days, we'll refund 100% of your money and let you out of the annual subscription, but you lose the license to the code in the Infrastructure as Code Library, so you must stop using it and delete all copies of the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, however, you remain a subscriber for at least 12 months, the license allows you to fork and modify the code and create derivative works as much as you want, and even if you cancel your subscription, you can keep using all the code you had been using up to that point. We recommend that prior to canceling, you make copies of all the repos in the Infrastructure as Code Library into your own version control system. After you cancel your Gruntwork Subscription, you'll no longer have access to the customer portal UI, or any of the updates, additions, and fixes we make to the Infrastructure as Code Library, support from the Gruntwork team, security alerts, and any other subscription benefits. However, your infrastructure will continue to work just fine and you'll still have all the code you had been using up to that point.
      </p>

  - question: How does the private beta work?
    answer: |
      <p>
        We are currently testing this product out on an invite-only basis with select customers. If you're interested in joining the beta, please request access, and we'll get in touch when the product is available to you!
      </p>

  - question: What's a user?
    answer: |
      <p>
        A user is any human or machine that makes use of Gruntwork's services, including using the Gruntwork Customer
        Portal, accessing code from the Infrastructure as Code Library, or submitting requests to support.
