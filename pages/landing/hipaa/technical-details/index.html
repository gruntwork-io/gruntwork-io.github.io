      Reference applications for common languages and frameworks such as Node.js/Express, Java/Spring, and Ruby/Rails. <br><br>
      The reference apps show how to implement common HIPAA compliance requirements, such as encryption at rest, encryption in transit, secrets management, server hardening, and much more.<br>
      <br>The reference applications also show how to implement cloud-native best practices, such as service discovery, schema migrations, application configuration, packaging, and much       more.
