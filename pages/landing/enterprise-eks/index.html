          <li>Cluster Autoscaler, Sealed Secrets, OPA, & more!</li>
      </ul>
      On top of that, all our enterprise-grade EKS clusters are hardened to meet 100% of the
      <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-cis-amazon-eks-benchmark/">CIS Amazon EKS Benchmark</a>
      requirements, regardless of the chosen technologies.

      Gruntwork takes your requested configuration, generates Terraform code for deploying your EKS cluster, and opens a pull request in a
      Git repo of your choice (we support GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket). The code you get has been proven in production at hundreds of companies, is commercially supported and maintained by Gruntwork, and is 100% yours: use it as-is or customize it as much as you want.

      Deploy your EKS cluster into your AWS account using one of the supported deployment tools:
      <ul>
          <li>Gruntwork Pipelines</li>
          <li>Terraform Cloud</li>

      Use Gruntwork tools to optimize your enterprise apps for EKS, including
      cloud-native and K8S-native best practices for packaging, monitoring, logging, service discovery, secrets management, schema
      migrations, and more. We support common enterprise languages and frameworks:
      <ul>
          <li>Java: Spring Boot, Quarkus</li>
          <li>Ruby: Ruby on Rails, Sinatra</li>
          <li>Python: Django, Flask</li>
          <li>Node.js: Express.js, Next.js</li>
      </ul>
      Or use our enterprise-grade reference applications as a template to implement the optimizations for any language
      and framework we don't support.

      Connect your Git repo to the CI/CD system (e.g., Argo CD) to automatically register, migrate, and deploy your apps
      using a friendly UI. Gruntwork Enterprise EKS supports various deployment strategies out of the box:
      <ul>
          <li>Canary</li>
          <li>Blue/Green</li>
          <li>Automatic rollbacks</li>
          <li>Security scans</li>
          <li>CI/CD workflows</li>
          <li>GitOps workflows</li>
      </ul>
      Regardless of deployment strategy and configuration, enforce your organization governance policies on artifacts
      using Open Policy Agent and Harbor.

      Use your chosen self-service dashboard to track deployment progress, review error messages, and troubleshoot
      errors in a powerful web UI.  Use observability tools to monitor your apps, including dashboards for container
      metrics, cluster data, one-click access to containers, and multiple options for centralized logging.

      All the modules and code is commercially supported and maintained. We push versioned updates to keep the
      infrastructure up to date:
      <ul>
          <li>Stay compatible across tool versions (Terraform, Terragrunt, kubectl, helm, etc)</li>
          <li>Regularly update to the latest Kubernetes version</li>
