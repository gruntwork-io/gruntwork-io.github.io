  - heading: "Use case 1: Update to Terraform 1.0 automatically"
    tab_block: site.data.patcher-landing-page-tabs-terraform-upgrade
    body: |
      You can use Patcher to automatically update a codebase containing Terraform modules to a new Terraform version, including new major versions that contain backwards incompatible changes. Patcher will help you update your codebase all the way from Terrafrom 0.11 to Terraform 1.0, and it supports incremental upgrades  (e.g., 0.11 -> 0.12 -> 0.13 -> 0.14 -> 0.15 -> 1.0). Patcher will scan your codebase and open a pull request, such as the one shown in the screenshot below, that transforms your code to use the new version of Terraform. For example, Terraform 0.12 had a particularly painful backwards incompatible upgrade, but Patcher can make such upgrades as painless and smooth as reviewing and merging a PR.
      At Gruntwork, we have created patches to automatically do each of the incremental upgrades. E.g. the patch that preforms the upgrade from 0.13 to 0.14 supports making these changes to the codebase: update `required_version` constraint in code; replace version constraints in `provider` blocks with `required_providers` configuration; update all the versions in `source` URLs to use the versions of Gruntwork modules that work with TF 0.14; update CI / CD config to use TF 0.14; update Terratest version to the version that supports TF 0.14; run `terraform fmt`; run `terraform validate`.

      <ul>
        <li>React 17.0 is a major release that had a number of breaking changes. As an example, one of the breaking changes in this release is that returning <code>undefined</code> from <code>forwardRef</code> and <code>memo</code> components is an error and you should return <code>null</code> instead.</li>
        <li>Use Patcher to update your code to React 17.0, by applying a <i>Patch File</i> that, among other things, ensures that <code>forwardRef</code> and <code>memo</code> components never return <code>undefined</code>.</li>
      </ul>

  - heading: "Use case 3: Update to Ruby on Rails 2.3.16/3.0.20 automatically"

    body: |
      Use Patcher to patch your code against security vulnerabilities. A few years ago, Ruby on Rails had a serious security vulnerability that allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, conduct SQL injection attacks, or bypass authentication. In addition to updating to the new version, a fix for it required changes to the code. By leveraging Patcher's <i>Patch Files</i>, you can automate critical updates such as these.

      Use Patcher to automate updates of internal dependencies. Let's say an internal team is working on a <code>security.jar</code> library that is used by hundreds of microservices within your company. After a new major version of <code>security.jar</code> has been released, you can use Patcher to conduct updates to other code bases that depend on <code>security.jar</code>. A <i>Patch File</i> in this case would bump the version of <code>security.jar</code>, as well as perform any other necessary code transformations in the code bases that depend on it.
