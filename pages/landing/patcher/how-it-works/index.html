      Reference applications for common languages and frameworks such as Node.js/Express, Java/Spring, and Ruby/Rails. <br><br>
      The reference apps show how to implement common HIPAA compliance requirements, such as encryption at rest, encryption in transit, secrets management, server hardening, and much more.<br>
      <br>The reference applications also show how to implement cloud-native best practices, such as service discovery, schema migrations, application configuration, packaging, and much       more.

  - heading: Update the code for your library
    image: /assets/img/landing-page-patcher/update-your-code.png
    image_side: right
    body: |
      Make changes to your library the usual way: create a branch, make some changes, and open a pull request.

  - heading: Run tests against all users of your library
    image: /assets/img/landing-page-patcher/example-patcher-upgrade-test.png
    image_side: left
    body: |
      Patcher discovers all users of your library within your company, runs their automated tests with your updated code, and gives you a report if those tests passed. That way, you know how your changes affect your downstream users before merging!

  - heading: Create a patch file
    precode: |
      <figure><figcaption>tf-13-to-14.patch</figcaption>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-yml">
              # This is an example Patch file to update from
              # Terraform 0.13 to 0.14
              code_transformations:
                # Update Terratest and Go modules to the latest

                # Update all Gruntwork modules
                - update_module_versions
                # Add required_providers block
                - replace_provider_versions_with_required_providers
              custom_scripts:
                # Run Terraform format
                - terraform_fmt
                # Run Terraform validate
                - terraform_validate

          </pre>
      </figure>
    image_side: left
    body: |
      If you are making backwards incompatible changes, you can create a Patch file to automatically upgrade the code of your library's users. Patch files can perform text transformations (e.g., add a new input variable) as well as execute custom scripts (e.g., run some CLI tools).

  - heading: Run tests against your patch
    image: /assets/img/landing-page-patcher/example-patcher-upgrade-test.png
    image_side: left
    body: |
      You can use <code>patcher plan</code> and <code>patcher apply</code> to test your patch against a repo. Patcher will also run your patch against all users of your library in a temporary branch and run their tests, so you can see check if both your code changes and patch are working.

  - heading: Merge and release
    image: /assets/img/landing-page-patcher/release.png
    image_width: 350px
    image_side: right
    body: |
      Merge and release as usual: e.g., create a new Git tag for the new version of your library, or push your new versioned artifact (e.g., <code>.jar</code>) to Artifactory.

user_how_it_works:
  - heading: Install the Patcher App
    image: /assets/img/landing-page-patcher/github-step-1.png
    image_side: right
    body: |
      Get Patcher up and running with just a few clicks. Start completely for free. You can find the app in GitHub, BitBucket, or GitLab.

  - heading: Patcher discovers your dependencies automatically
    image: /assets/img/landing-page-patcher/patcher-ui-tf.png
    image_side: left
    body: |
      Patcher discovers dependencies for popular languages and tools such as JavaScript, Ruby, Java, Python, Go, Terraform and Docker. You can also add special comments to your code to help Patcher discover dependencies in non-standard locations (e.g., in a Bash script).

  - heading: Patcher automatically patches your code and opens a pull request
    image: /assets/img/landing-page-patcher/terraform-12-pr.png
    image_side: right
    body: |
      Patcher updates you to the new version and runs the maintainer's patches to update your code in case of backwards incompatible changes. All patches are run in a secure, sandboxed environment, so your code is always kept safe.

  - heading: You review and merge
    image: /assets/img/landing-page-patcher/large-review-pr.png
    image_side: left
    body: |
      You review the pull request, check if your automated tests have passed, and if everything looks good, you can merge, safely and easily keeping all your dependencies up to date.
