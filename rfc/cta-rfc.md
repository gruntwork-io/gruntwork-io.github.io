## RFC for CTA

### Using Existing intercom as CTA
#### Pros

- We can make use of the existing intercom based on our needs.

- We can use can automatically set how long before the intercom pops up on a page. 

- We can also specify what pages to display a specific message eg. for the deployment guides, we can have, Have us deploy for you?

- It has its own builtin tracking so we can conveniently track how many users clicked on our buttons more information can be found [here](<https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/317-your-message-statistics-explained>)\

- We can target our audience based on some good criteria. E.g If it is the first time on the page, referred from an external link, etc.

#### Cons 

- We can have only one intercom just as we currently have but the message to be displayed can differ. 

- We cannot have different styles applied for different webpages. . It stays uniform

- The same teammates show on all pages. It cannot be edited based on different webpages but if we want to change the routes of where conversations go based on cusomers starting a conversation, we could setup Assignment Rules from the Start a conversation button. There we would be able to route customers to different inboxes or teammates based on their keywords, attributes and or the webpage they are visiting from. We will need to upgrade to Inbox Pro to use this feature. More on this [here](<https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/199-assign-conversations-to-teammates-and-teams>)

- We cannot use GA tracking to track the buttons clicked

### Creating our own CTA

#### Pros

- We will have control over the styling

- We can decide when it should be displayed or shouldn't

- We can track using GA

#### Cons

- All we are trying to implement has already been implemented by intercom and even better.

#### Conclusion 
We should go with the existing intercom and make some changes so it can go live.
